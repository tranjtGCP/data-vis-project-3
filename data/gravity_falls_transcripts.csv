Tourist Trapped,Narration,"The monster pulls out a large tree and throws it above Dipper and Mabel, straight in their path."
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,Look out!
Tourist Trapped,Narration,"When screaming, the image freezes with Mabel and Dipper screaming as they drive into the screen."
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,"Rest assured, there's a perfectly logical explanation."

Tourist Trapped,Dipper,Let's rewind...(Flashback to Dipper and Mabel in their living room at home)It all began when ourparentsdecided we could use some fresh air.
Tourist Trapped,Narration,"Their parents take their stuff away, give them bags and put some sunscreen on their noses. Cut to a map of Oregon. Zoom in to Gravity Falls."

Tourist Trapped,Stan,"Ladies and gentlemen, behold; the Sascrotch!"
Tourist Trapped,Narration,"Cut to a Sasquatch wearing underwear. Tourists start speaking excitedly, and snap pictures. Cut to Dipper sweeping the wooden floor with a broom. Mabel is looking at stuff."
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,(Narrating:)And guess who had to work there.(Not narrating; sighs)
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,Ooh!(Reaches for large eyeball)

Tourist Trapped,Dipper,"(Spraying a jar with water and wiping it; not narrating:)Mabel, I know you're going through your whole ""Boy Crazy"" phase, but I think you're kind of overdoing it with the ""crazy"" part."
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,"What?!(Blows raspberry)Comeon, Dipper! This is our first summer away from home! It's my big chance to have an epic summer romance!"
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,"Yeah, but do you need to flirt witheveryguy you meet?"

Tourist Trapped,Mattress King,Aaah!(Cowers away from Mabel and drops scepter)
Tourist Trapped,Narration,Cut back to the present.
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,"Mock all you want, brother, but I got a good feeling about this summer. I wouldn't be surprised if the man of my dreams walked through that door right now."

Tourist Trapped,Mabel,Aww! Why?!
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,Ha ha ha!
Tourist Trapped,Stan,"All right, all right, look alive, people. I need someone to go hammer up these signs in the spooky part of theforest."
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,(Quickly:)Not it.
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,(Quickly:)Not it.
Tourist Trapped,Soos,"(Raises his hand while drilling a shelf)Uh, also not it."
Tourist Trapped,Stan,"Nobody asked you, Soos."
Tourist Trapped,Soos,"I know, and I'm comfortable with that.(Eats chocolate bar)"
Tourist Trapped,Stan,"Wendy, I need you to put up this sign!"
Tourist Trapped,Wendy,"(Pretends to reach for signs)I would, but I, ugh, can't, ugh, reach it, ugh..."
Tourist Trapped,Stan,"I'd fire all of you if I could. All right, let's make it... eenie, meenie, miney...(Points at Dipper)you."
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,"Aw, what? Grunkle Stan, whenever I'm in those woods, I feel like I'm being watched."
Tourist Trapped,Stan,"Ugh, this again."
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,"I'm telling you, something weird is going on in this town. Just today, my mosquito bites spelled out BEWARE."
Tourist Trapped,Stan,"(Looks at Dipper's arm)...That says ""BEWARB.""(Dipper looks at his arm and scratches it)Look, kid. The whole ""monsters in the forest"" thing is just local legend, drummed up by guys like me to sell merch to guys like that."
Tourist Trapped,Narration,A seemingly obsessed touristlaughs while looking at a Stan bobblehead in action.
Tourist Trapped,Stan,So quit being so paranoid!(Gives Dipper the signs; Dipper sighs)
Tourist Trapped,Narration,Cut to a foggy forest with trees getting blown by the wind.
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,"Ugh, Grunkle Stan. Nobody ever believes anything I say.(Puts one sign up on a tree that says ""To The Mystery Shack."" He starts to hammer a nail on anothertree trunk, but it makes a metallic sound.)Huh?(He taps the tree with the hammer, which makes more metallic sounds. He wipes away some dust and opens a secret window revealing a mechanical box with two control switches on top. He tests one control but nothing happens. Then he tries the other. Behind him, a hatch opens up in the ground. Gompers bleats and runs away.)What the...?"
Tourist Trapped,Narration,"Dipper looks inside the hatch, and there is a thick tatteredbook. It is fully covered in dust with multiple cobwebs and scurrying millipedes. He picks the book up and blows the dust off the front cover, revealing a gold six-fingered left handprint with a number ""3"" written on its palm. He places it on the ground, and checks for people watching. He opens the book with the words ""Property of--"" on the first page and an eye-glass is in it. He looks at the eye-glass and puts it down. He flips another page, and begins reading aloud:"
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,"""It's hard to believe it's been six years sinceIbegan studying the strange and wondrous secrets of Gravity Falls, Oregon.""(Flips through the journal's pages of floating eyeballs, giant vampire bats and gnomes)What is all this?(Stops at a page that says ""TRUST NO ONE!"" and starts reading)""Unfortunately, my suspicions have been confirmed. I'm being watched. I must hide this book beforeHefinds it. Remember – In Gravity Falls, there is no one you can trust.""(Closes Journal)No one you can trust..."
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,(Jumps up behind Dipper's back on a log)HELLO!
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,AH!
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,"What'cha readin', some nerd thing?"
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,"(Hides journal behind back)Uh, uh, it's nothing!"
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,"(Mocking Dipper:)""Uh, uh, it's nothing!""(Laughs)What? Are you actually not gonna show me?"
Tourist Trapped,Gompers,(Nibbles the edge of the journal)
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,Uhhh...(Glances at Gompers)Let's go somewhere private.
Tourist Trapped,Narration,Cut to a view of the Mystery Shack. Dipper and Mabel are in the living room.
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,"It's amazing! Grunkle Stan said I was being paranoid, but according to this book, Gravity Falls has this secret dark side.(Shows Mabel a page)"
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,Whoa! Shut. Up!(Pushes Dipper)
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,"And get this! After a certain point, the pages just stop, like the guy who was writing it... mysteriously disappeared.(Doorbell rings)Who's that?"
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,"Well, time to spill the beans.(Knocks over a can of beans on the table)Boop. Beans. This girl's got a date! Woot woot!(Falls backward into the chair, giggling)"
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,"Let me get this straight: in the half hour I was gone, you already found a boyfriend?"
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,What can I say? I guess I'm just...(Waving her sweater sleeves loosely)IRRESISTIBLLLLE!(Doorbell rings twice)Oh. Coming!(Runs out)
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,(Sits down in chair and begins to read the Journal)
Tourist Trapped,Stan,"(Walks in and sees Dipper)What'cha reading there, slick?"
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,"Oh!(Quickly hides the book under the seat cushion and grabs a magazine)I was just catching up on, uh...(Sees the cover of the magazine)""Gold Chains For Old Men Magazine""?"
Tourist Trapped,Stan,That's a good issue.
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,"(Standing next toNorman)Hey, family! Say hello to my new boyfriend!"
Tourist Trapped,Narration,"Mabel's boyfriend turns to see Dipper and Stan. He appears to look unsettling with pale skin, hair covering his left eye, a visible fang and red liquid seen on his right cheek. He is limp and wearing a torn black zipped hoodie."
Tourist Trapped,Norman,'Sup?
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,Hey...
Tourist Trapped,Stan,How's it hanging?
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,We met at thecemetery. He'sreallydeep.(Feels his arm)Oh. Little muscle there. That's...what a surprise...
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,"So, what's your name?"
Tourist Trapped,Norman,(Struggling to speak)Uh... Normal... Man?!
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,He means Norman.
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,"Are you bleeding, Norman?"
Tourist Trapped,Norman,(With a red liquid dripping down his face)It's jam.
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,(Gasps)Ilovejam! Look. At. This!
Tourist Trapped,Norman,"So, you wanna go hold hands or... whatever...?"
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,"Oh, oh, my goodness.(Giggles)Don't wait up!(Runs out)"
Tourist Trapped,Norman,(Points at Stan and Dipper and runs into the wall several times on his way out)
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,(Narrating:)There was something about Norman that wasn't right. I decided to consult the journal.
Tourist Trapped,Narration,Scene transitions to Dipper in the attic.
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,"(Reading aloud from the Journal:)""Known for their pale skin and bad attitudes, these creatures are often mistaken for... teenagers?! Beware Gravity Falls's nefarious...""(Gasps)"
Tourist Trapped,Narration,We see the journal page onThe Undead. The picture of the zombie becomes Norman.
Tourist Trapped,Norman,(As the zombie on the journal page:)'Sup.
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,ZOMBIE!(Echoing)
Tourist Trapped,Narration,Cut to Stan in the bathroom.
Tourist Trapped,Stan,"Somebody say ""crombie""? What is that, crombie? That's not even a word. You're losing your mind."
Tourist Trapped,Narration,Dipper looks out the window to see Norman walking towards Mabel with outstretched arms while moaning.
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,I like you.
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,"Oh, no! Mabel! No, no, Mabel, watch out!"
Tourist Trapped,Norman,(Moans as he puts hands around Mabel's neck)
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,AHHHHH!
Tourist Trapped,Norman,"(Groans in satisfaction and removes arms, revealing flower necklace)"
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,(Gasps)Daisies? You scallywag...
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,"(Turns away from the window, thinking)Is my sister really dating a zombie, or am I just going nuts?"
Tourist Trapped,Soos,"(Offscreen)It's a dilemma, to be sure.(Dipper gasps, sees Soos fixing a lightbulb next to him)I couldn't help but overhear you talkin' aloud to yourself in this empty room."
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,"Soos, you've seen Mabel's boyfriend. He's gotta be a zombie, right?"
Tourist Trapped,Soos,Hmm. How many brains didja see the guy eat?
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,(Looks down)Zero.
Tourist Trapped,Soos,"Look, dude, I believe you. I'm always noticing weird stuff in this town. Like themailman? Pretty sure that dude's a werewolf."
Tourist Trapped,Narration,"Flashback of a hairy mailman walking by Soos, who is eating his lunch outside. Soos scoots away from him, suspicious."
Tourist Trapped,Soos,"But ya gotta have evidence. Otherwise, people are gonna think you’re a major league cuckoo clock."
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,"As always, Soos, you’re right."
Tourist Trapped,Soos,My wisdom is both a blessing and a curse.
Tourist Trapped,Stan,(Shouting offscreen:)Soos! The portable toilets are clogged again!
Tourist Trapped,Soos,(Adjusts his hat)I am needed elsewhere.(Leaves the room by walking backwards)
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,(Narrating:)My sister could be in trouble. It was time to get some evidence.
Tourist Trapped,Narration,Cut to Dipper filming Mabel and Norman in the park. Upbeat chiptune music plays in the background.
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,"(Throws a Frisbee at Norman's head, who fails to catch it and falls over)"
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,(Stops looking through camera and frowns at Norman)
Tourist Trapped,Narration,Cut to Norman breaking through a door window to open it from the inside and letting Mabel inside the diner.
Tourist Trapped,Norman,"(Stumbles around and crashes, trying to follow Mabel)"
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,(Looks out from behind menu)
Tourist Trapped,Narration,Cut to Mabel and Norman frolicking in a field.
Tourist Trapped,Norman,"(Falls into an open grave, then crawls out, hand first, screaming)"
Tourist Trapped,Mabel and Norman,"(Pause, then laugh)"
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,(Narrating:)I'd seen enough.
Tourist Trapped,Narration,Cut to Mabel and Dipper's room. Mabel is brushing her hair and Dipper enters.
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,(Not narrating:)Mabel. We've gotta talk about Norman.
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,"Isn’t he the best? Check out this giant smooch mark he gave me!(Shows her cheek, which has a large red spot on it)"
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,Ah!
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,"Ha, ha! Gullible. It was just an accident with the leaf blower!"
Tourist Trapped,Narration,Flashback to Mabel with a leaf blower.
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,"(Putting a picture of Norman on leaf blower's tube)Kissing practice!(Leans in to leaf blower, but then it sucks in the picture and sticks to her face as well; she runs around)AHHH! Turn it off! Turn it off!"
Tourist Trapped,Narration,Cut back to present.
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,That was fun.
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,"No, Mabel, listen! I’m trying to tell you that Norman is not what he seems!(Shows her the Journal)"
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,(Gasps)You think he might be a vampire? That would be soawesome!
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,"Guess again, sister. Sha-BAM!(Holds book open to the Gnomes page)"
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,Agh!
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,"Oh, wait. I'm-I'm sorry...(Flips to Undead page)Shabam!"
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,"(Doubtfully)A zombie? That is not funny, Dipper."
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,"(Puts the Journal back into his vest)I'm not joking! It all adds up: the bleeding, the limp... He never blinks! Have you noticed that?"
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,Maybehe'sblinking whenyou'reblinking.
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,"Mabel, remember what the book said about Gravity Falls? ""Trust no one!"""
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,"Well, what aboutme, huh? Why can’t you trust me?(Puts on star earrings)Beep-bop!"
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,"Mabel,(shaking her)he's gonna eat your brain!"
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,"(Pushes him away, feeling angry)Dipper, listen to me. Norman and I are going on a date at five o’clock, and I'm gonna be ADORABLE, and he's gonna be DREAMY...(pushing Dipper out of the room)"
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,Wait! Bu-bu-but—
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,And I am not gonna let you ruin it with one of your crazy CONSPIRACIES!(Slams the door)
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,(Sighs and sits down)What am I gonna do?
Tourist Trapped,Narration,"Cut to the owl clock, which tells the time at 5:00. The doorbell rings."
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,"(Pulls on her purple sweater as she excitedly races downstairs)Coming!(Sees Norman)Hey, Norman. How do I look?(Closeup on her sparkling sweater with a cat's head and the words ""MEOW WOW!"" on it)"
Tourist Trapped,Norman,Shiny...
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,You always know what to say!(Walks off with him)
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,"(Watching the video he collected)Soos was right. I don't have any real evidence.(Video shows Mabel teaching Norman hopscotch, but he only falls over; Dipper fast forwards to Mabel and Norman with Norman's arm around Mabel)I guess I can be kind of paranoid sometimes and—(on the tape, Norman's hand falls off; he glances around, then reattaches it)Wait, WHAT?!(Rewinds the tape and watches it again; he screams and tips the chair backwards)I was right! Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!(Races outside)Grunkle Stan, Grunkle Stan! Grunkle Stan!"
Tourist Trapped,Stan,(On a stage in front of a bunch of tourists; to the crowd:)And here we have Rock that looks like a face rock: the rock that looks like a face.
Tourist Trapped,Unnamed hillbilly,Does it look like a rock?
Tourist Trapped,Stan,"No, it looks like a face."
Tourist Trapped,Fat Tourist,Is it a face?
Tourist Trapped,Stan,It's a rock thatlookslike a face!
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,Over here! Grunkle Stan!
Tourist Trapped,Stan,"For the fifth time, it's-it's not an actual face!"
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,(Grimaces)Errrgh!!
Tourist Trapped,Narration,Cut to Mabel and Norman in the woods.
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,"Finally, we're alone."
Tourist Trapped,Norman,(Ominously)Yes.Alone...
Tourist Trapped,Narration,Cut back to the Mystery Shack. Dipper desperately tries to get Stan's attention from the visitors.
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,"Stan! Stan!(Sees Wendy drive up in a golf cart and runs over)Wendy! Wendy, Wendy! I need to borrow the golf cart so I can save my sister from a zombie!"
Tourist Trapped,Wendy,(Gives Dipper the key and walks off with a wink)Try not to hit any pedestrians.

Tourist Trapped,Soos,"Dude, it's me, Soos. This is for the zombies.(Gives Dipper a shovel)"
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,Thanks.
Tourist Trapped,Soos,(Holds up a baseball bat)And this is in case you see a piñata.

Tourist Trapped,Narration,Cut back to the woods.
Tourist Trapped,Norman,"Uh, Mabel, now that we’ve gotten to know each other, there's...(exhales)...there's something I should tell you."
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,"Oh, Norman, you can tell me anything!(Thinking:)Please be a vampire, please be a vampire...!"
Tourist Trapped,Norman,"All right, just... just don’t freak out, okay? Just... just keep an open mind, be cool.(Unzips his hoodie and throws it off; underneath are five gnomes standing on top of each other. The top gnome speaks)"
Tourist Trapped,Jeff,Is this weird? Is this too weird? Do you need to sit down?
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,(Stares at the gnomes in total shock)
Tourist Trapped,Jeff,"R-r-right, I'll explain. So! We’re gnomes. First off. Get that one outta the way."
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,(Still shocked)Uh...

Tourist Trapped,Jeff,"(Snaps his fingers)Shmebulock! Yes!(Mabel sits down on a rock, slaps her head)Anyways, long story short, us gnomes have been lookin' for a new queen! Right, guys?"
Tourist Trapped,Gnomes except Jeff,Queen! Queen! Queen!
Tourist Trapped,Jeff,"Heh, so whaddya say?(Taps Steve with his foot, and the gnomes work together to make ""Norman"" kneel in a proposing fashion. A small case opens to reveal a diamond ring)Will you join us in holy matri-gnome-y? Matri...matri-mo-ny! Bleahh! Can't talk today!"
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,"Look... I'm sorry, guys. You're really sweet, but... I'm a girl and you're gnomes, and it's like, ""what?!"" Yikes..."
Tourist Trapped,Jeff,"We understand. We'll never forget you, Mabel.(The gnomes look sad and Mabel smiles)Because we're gonna kidnap you."
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,Huh?!

Tourist Trapped,Dipper,"Don't worry, Mabel! I'll save you from that zombie!"
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,(Off-screen)Help!
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,Hold on!
Tourist Trapped,Narration,Dipper drives down a deep underground tunnel to the gnomes' hideout. He sees the gnomes trying to pin down Mabel.
Tourist Trapped,Jeff,"The more you struggle, the more awkward this is gonna be for everybody! Just, ha ha, okay. Get her arm there, Steve!"
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,(With Steve biting her sweater arm)Let go of me!(Punches Steve off)

Tourist Trapped,Dipper,"Gnomes? Huh, I waswayoff...(Takes the journal out of his vest and reads the relevant page aloud:)""Gnomes: little men of the Gravity Falls Forest. Weaknesses: unknown.""(When Dipper lowers the book, he sees that the gnomes have managed to tie Mabel to the ground)"
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,"Aw, come on!"
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,"(Walks up to Jeff)Hey, HEY! Let go of my sister!"
Tourist Trapped,Jeff,"Oh! Haha, hey there! Um, you know, this is all really just a big misunderstanding. You see, your sister's not in danger. She's just marrying all one thousand of us and becoming our gnome queen for all eternity! Isn't that right, honey?"
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,You guys are butt-faces!
Tourist Trapped,Gnome,"(Covers Mabel's mouth, muffling her)"
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,Mmmm-MMMMM!
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,"(Holds up the shovel he brought, pointing it at Jeff)Give her back right now, or else!"

Tourist Trapped,Jeff,"You've messed with the wrong creatures, boy! Gnomes of the forest...ASSEMBLE!!"
Tourist Trapped,Narration,"Hearing Jeff's thunderous cry, hundreds of gnomes come out of giant mushrooms and trees to gather around Jeff in the middle. They stack themselves up and link hands, forming a pyramid with Jeff at the top. Outside, Dipper drives the golf cart at full speed with Mabel beside him."
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,"Hurry, before they come after us!"
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,"I wouldn't worry about it, see their little legs? Those suckers are tiny!(Stops the cart as he hears a stomping sound; a giant stacked gnome monster stops behind the cart)"
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,Dang.
Tourist Trapped,Jeff,"(On the top, using gnomes' hats like levers)All right, teamwork, guys, like we practiced.(Gnome monster raises its arms in the air, roaring)"
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,"Move, MOVE!"

Tourist Trapped,Gnome,(Hanging from side of cart)Ha ha!
Tourist Trapped,Narration,"Mabel elbow punches a gnome off. Shmebulock jumps up behind Dipper, who grabs him and slams him into the steering wheel out of annoyance."
Tourist Trapped,Shmebulock,Shmebulock...(Falls out of the cart)
Tourist Trapped,Gnome,(Jumps onto the cart and claws Dipper's face)
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,"I'll save you, Dipper!(Repeatedly punches the gnome off of Dipper's face and the gnome falls off with Dipper's hat)"
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,"(Dazed from the punches)Thanks, Mabel..."
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,Don't mention it.
Tourist Trapped,Gnome Giant,(Picks up tree and throws it)
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,Look out!
Tourist Trapped,Dipper and Mabel,AAAAAAHHHHHH!
Tourist Trapped,Narration,"The cart overturns, landing next to the Mystery Shack."

Tourist Trapped,Stan,(Holding up a swirly pattern on a stick)Behold; the world's most distracting object!(Pulls the string and rotates into a continuous spiral)
Tourist Trapped,Tourists,Oooh...
Tourist Trapped,Stan,"Just try to look away, you can't.(Long pause)I can't even remember what I was talking about..."
Tourist Trapped,Jeff,"It's the end of the line, kids! Mabel, marry us before we do something crazy!"
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,There's gotta be a way out of this!
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,I gotta do it.
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,"What?! Mabel, don't do this! Are you crazy?"
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,Trust me.
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,What?
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,"Dipper, just this once. Trust me!"

Tourist Trapped,Mabel,(Holds out hand)
Tourist Trapped,Jeff,"(Puts the ring on her hand)Bada-bing, bada-bam! Now let's get you back into the forest, honey!"
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,You may now kiss the bride.
Tourist Trapped,Jeff,"Well, don't mind if I do.(Leans up to kiss Mabel)"
Tourist Trapped,Narration,"As Jeff leans in for a kiss, Mabel leans backwards and turns on the leaf-blower behind her. She aims at Jeff to pull him into the suction."
Tourist Trapped,Jeff,"Ah! Hey, hey, wait a minute!(Dipper and the gnomes gasp in surprised shock)Whoa, whoa! Wh-what's goin' on?!(Gets sucked half-way into leaf-blower)"
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,(Angrily)That's for lying to me!(Increases the sucking power)THAT'S for breaking my heart!
Tourist Trapped,Jeff,(Slowly getting sucked in further)Ow! My face!
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,And THIS is for messing with my brother!(Aims at the gnome monster; to Dipper:)Wanna do the honors?
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,On three!
Tourist Trapped,Dipper & Mabel,"One, two, three!(Blast Jeff towards the gnome monster)"
Tourist Trapped,Gnome Giant,(Explodes into separate gnomes)
Tourist Trapped,Jeff,(Flying off into the distance)I-I-I'LL GET YOU BACK FOR THI-I-IS...!!!(Other gnomes scream when they fall)
Tourist Trapped,Gnome,Who's giving orders?! I need orders!
Tourist Trapped,Gnome 2,My arms are tired...
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,"(Triumphantly; while Mabel moves the leaf-blower back and forth, blowing gnomes as they retreat into the woods)Anyone else want some?"
Tourist Trapped,Gnomes,(Run off on all fours; one gets caught in a six-pack holder)
Tourist Trapped,Gompers,(Picks the six-pack holder up and runs off)Bah-ah-ah.
Tourist Trapped,Gnome in the six-pack holder,(In the background)Aaaaahhhhh!
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,"Hey, Dipper? I, um...I'm sorry for ignoring your advice. You really were just looking out for me."
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,"Oh, don't be like that. You saved our butts back there."
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,I guess I'm just sad that my first boyfriend turned out to be a bunch of gnomes.
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,Look on the bright side. Maybe the next onewillbe a vampire!
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,"Oh, you're just saying that!"
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,Awkward sibling hug?
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,Awkward sibling hug.
Tourist Trapped,Dipper & Mabel,"(Hug and pat each other)Pat, pat."
Tourist Trapped,Narration,The two walk into the Mystery Shack's gift shop. Dipper closes the door back with his right foot. They see Stan sorting a wad of dollar bills.
Tourist Trapped,Stan,Yeesh. You two get hit by a bus or something? A-hah!
Tourist Trapped,Dipper and Mabel,(Begin to walk away)
Tourist Trapped,Stan,"Uh, hey, w-wouldn't you know it, um... I accidentally overstocked some inventory, so, uh... how's about each of you take one item from the gift shop? On the house, y'know?"
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,Really?
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,(Folds arms)What's the catch?
Tourist Trapped,Stan,"The catch is do it before I change my mind, now take something.(Elbows the cash register open)"
Tourist Trapped,Dipper & Mabel,(Look around at items)

Tourist Trapped,Mabel,"And I will have a...(Grabs item from box, hides it, twirls around and raises it up in the air)GRAPPLING HOOK! Yes!"
Tourist Trapped,Stan,"(To Dipper:)Wouldn't she rather have, like... a doll or something?"
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,(Fires the grappling hook up at the ceiling; it catches and pulls her up)Grappling hook!
Tourist Trapped,Stan,Fair enough!
Tourist Trapped,Narration,"Cut to Mabel and Dipper's bedroom. Dipper is writing while Mabel jumps on her bed, laughing."
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,"(Writing in Journal while narrating:)""This journal told me there was no one in Gravity Falls I could trust.(Looking at Mabel)But when you battle a hundred gnomes side-by-side with someone, you realize that they've probably always got your back."""
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,"(Shoots grappling hook, then reels it back with a stuffed animal attached)"
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,"Hey, Mabel, could you get the light?"
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,I'm on it!(Knocks light out the window with the grappling hook)It worked!
Tourist Trapped,Dipper and Mabel,(Laugh)
Tourist Trapped,Mabel,These grappling hooks...
Tourist Trapped,Dipper,"(Narrating:)""Our uncle told us there was nothing strange about this town. But who knows what other secrets are waiting to be unlocked?"""
Tourist Trapped,Narration,"Cut to the Mystery Shack exterior. Pan down to see Stan as he walks in holding a lantern. He goes into the gift shop and puts a code into thevending machine. The machine opens, revealing a secret passageway and Stan walks inside, looking side-to-side before closing it behind him."

The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Stan,"Ha ha. Nah, but with these cataracts I might as well be. What is that, a woodpecker?(Drives through a wooden guardrail, making the twins scream)"

The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Stan,"Come on, this is gonna be great! I've never had fishing buddies before. The guys from the lodge won't go with me: they don't ""like"" or ""trust"" me."
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Mabel,"(Quietly, to Dipper:)I think he actually wants to fish with us."
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Stan,"Hey, I know what'll cheer you sad sacks up.(Slaps hats on Dipper and Mabel)Pow! Pines family fishing hats! That-that's hand stitching, you know."

The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Narration,Dipper and Mabel stop chanting and stare at McGucket.
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,McGucket,Monster... Eh... I'll go.
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Narration,A large honking sound is heard.
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Soos Ramirez,(Pulls up in hisboat)You dudes say somethin' about a monster hunt?
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Mabel,Soos!
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Soos,"Wassup, hambone!(Soos and Mabel fist bump and make explosion noises)Dude, you could totally use my boat for your hunt. It's got a steering wheel, chairs; normal boat stuff."
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Stan,"All right, all right, let's think this through. Ya kids could go waste your time on some epic monster-finding adventure,oryou could spend the day learning how to tie knots and skewer worms with your Great Uncle Stan!"
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Narration,The twins look at Soos in his boat; he does a robot dance. They look back at Stan in his leaky old boat; he sniffs his left armpit. They look at Scuttlebutt Island in the distance. They grin at each other.
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Stan,"So, whaddaya say?"
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Narration,"The twins drive off laughing with Soos in his boat toward Scuttlebutt Island, leaving Stan behind."

The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Stan,"Ingrates! Aw, who needs 'em? I got a whole box of creepy fishing lures to keepmecompany.(After a moment of looking at the lure with flies buzzing around them, Stan cringes in disgust and closes the box)"

The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Mabel & Soos,Yay!
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Narration,"The boat does a U-turn away from the island. Underwater, a strange shape swims by."
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Narration,Cut to black for commercial break.
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Narration,The scene begins with Dipper pacing on the boat in front of Mabel and Soos.
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Dipper,"Alright. If we wanna win this contest, we've gotta do it right! Think. What's the number one problem with most monster hunts?"
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Soos,"You're a side character and you die within the first five minutes of the movie. Dude, am I a side character?! Do you ever think about stuff like that?"
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Dipper,"No, no, no... Camera trouble! Say Bigfoot shows up. Soos, be Bigfoot?"

The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Dipper,"(In mock acting voice)There he is! Bigfoot!(Pats life vest)Uh-oh, no camera!(Pulls camera out of jacket)Oh, wait, here's one! Aw, no film!(In normal voice)You see? You see what I'm, doing here?"
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Soos,"Oh, yeah. Dude's got a point."
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Dipper,"That's why I boughtseventeendisposable cameras!(Revealing cameras as he lists off their locations)Two on my ankle, three in my jacket, four for each of you, three extras in this bag, and one... under my hat! There's no way we're gonna miss this. Okay everybody, let's test our cameras out!"
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Soos,"(Takes a picture of himself, the flash startling him)Aw, dude!(Throws the camera overboard)"
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Dipper,You see? This is exactly why you need backup cameras. We still have sixteen!
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Mabel,"(Throws a camera at a seagull flying over her head)Ah, bird!"
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Dipper,"Fifteen! Okay, guys, I repeat; don't lose your cameras!"
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Soos,"Wait, lose the cameras?"

The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Soos,"Dude, I just threw two away."
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Dipper,Thirteen! All right! We still have thirteen camera--(He accidentally crushes one with his fist)twelve. We have twelve cameras.
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Mabel,So what's the plan? Throw more cameras overboard or what?
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Dipper,"NO! No. Okay. You'll be lookout, Soos can work the steering wheel, and I'll be captain."
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Mabel,"What? Why do you get to be captain? What about Mabel, huh?(Chanting)Ma-bel! Ma-bel! Ma-bel! Ma-bel!"
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Dipper,I'm not sure that's a good idea.
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Mabel,What about co-captain?
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Dipper,There's no such thing as co-captain.
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Mabel,"Aw, whoops.(Tosses a camera into the water)"
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Dipper,"Okay, fine! You can be co-captain."
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Soos,Can I be associate co-captain?
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Mabel,"As co-captain, I authorize that request."
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Dipper,"Well, as first co-captain, our number one order of business is to lure the monster out with this.(Gestures at a barrel of Fish Food)"
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Soos,Permission to taste some?
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Dipper,Granted.
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Mabel,Permission co-granted.
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Soos,"Permission associate co-granted.(Licks some, than gags and wipes his tongue, coughing)Dude, I don't know what I expected that to taste like!"
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Dipper and Mabel,(Laughing)
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Dipper,"Oh, Soos..."
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Stan,"(Watching them)Traitors! Ah, I'll find my own fishing buddies!(Looks around and sees a couple sitting in a boat up ahead)Ah!(Starts his boat's engine)There's my new pals!"
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Reginald,"(Turned away fromRosanna, looking at a ring in a box; he takes a breath)Now that we're alone, Rosanna, there's a burning question which my heart longs to ask of you."
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Rosanna,"(Tearing up)Oh, Reginald!"
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Stan,"Hey!(Pulls his boat up to theirs)Wanna hear a joke? Here goes. My ex-wife still misses me...but her aim is gettin' better!(Pause)Her aim is gettin' better!(Pause)Y'see, it's-it's funny because marriage is terrible."
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Reginald and Rosanna,(Row their boat away)
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Stan,What?
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Narration,Cut to S.S. Cool Dude approaching Scuttlebutt Island. There is fog everywhere. Soos is at the back of the boat shoveling fish food over the side. Dipper and Mabel are at the front. Dipper is trying to see through the fog while Mabel is playing ventriloquist with a pelican.
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Mabel,Hey! How's it going?(As pelican:)It's going awesome! Bow bow buh bow bow!
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Dipper,"Mabel, leave that thing alone."
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Mabel,"(As pelican:)Aw, I don't mind none!(As Mabel:)Hey, look, I'm drinking water!(As pelican while drinking water:)Grinkle, grinkle little...(chokes on water and coughs, and the pelican flies away)"
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Dipper,Aren't you supposed to be doing lookout?
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Mabel,"Look out!(Throws a volley ball at Dipper, hitting him on the arm)"
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Dipper,(Holds arm and shivers)
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Mabel,"Heh, heh. But seriously, I'm on it."
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Narration,"The boat jolts to a sudden stop, having crashed into the shore of the island."
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Mabel,"See? We're here! I'm a lookout genius! Hamster ball, here we come!"
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Narration,"The trio disembarks and ventures into the foggy woods. Dipper leads the group while carrying a lantern. They soon come to a large sign nailed to a tree that says ""Scuttlebutt Island."" Soos and Mabel stop in front of it."
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Soos,"Dude, check it out.(Covers the ""Scuttle"" part of the sign)Butt Island."
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Mabel,"Soos, you rapscallion!(To Dipper:)Hey! Why aren't you laughing? Are youscared?"
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Dipper,"Pssh! Yeah, right! I'm not--"
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Mabel,"(Pokes him on the nose and blows a raspberry)Yeah, you are!"
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Dipper,Hey!(He drops the lantern as Mabel continues poking him and blowing raspberries)Quit...! Stop! Mabel!
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Narration,There's a growling noise in the distance. Mabel stops teasing Dipper and they look around. Soos comes up to them.
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Soos,"Dude, did you guys hear that?"
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Mabel,What was that? Was it your stomach?
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Soos,"Nah, my stomach normally sounds like whale noises."
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Mabel,"(Listens to Soos' stomach, which makes whale noises)Wow! So majestic."
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Possum,(Grabs lantern and runs away)
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Dipper,(Gasps)Our lantern! Aww! I can't see anything!
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Soos,"Duuude, I dunno, man. Maybe this, uh... Maybe this isn't worth it."
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Dipper,"Not worth it? Guys, imagine what would happen if we got that picture!"
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Narration,"Cut to Dipper's imagination, where he is dressed likeIndiana Jonesbeing interviewed on a talk show."
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Charlie,"Tonight we're here with adventure seeker Dipper Pines, who bravely photographed the elusive Gobblewonker! Tell me, Dipper: what's the secret to your success?"
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Dipper,"Well, I run away from nothing.(Dumps coffee into mouth; an embarrassing picture of Grunkle Stan appears on screen)Nothing, except for when I ran away from my annoying Grunkle Stan, who I ditched in order to pursue that lake monster."
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Charlie,"How right you were to do so. He looked like a real piece of work. I don't often do this, but I feel the need to give you an award!(Gives him a medal and they get their picture taken)"
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Mabel,"(Crashes through the wall in a hamster ball)CHARLIE! WHY WON'T YOU INTERVIEW ME?!(Chases after Dipper and Charlie, screaming like a maniac)"
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Narration,Cut back to real life.
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Dipper,(Smiles)I'm in!
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Mabel,"Me, too!"
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Dipper and Mabel,(Run off)
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Soos,"All right, dudes, I'm comin'!(Chases them)"
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Soos,(Beatboxing)
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Mabel,My name is Mabel!It rhymes with table!It also rhymes with... glabel!It also rhymes with... shmabel!
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Soos,"Dude, we should be writing this down."
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Dipper,"(Holding a camera) Guys, guys, guys! You hear something?"
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Narration,"The growling noise from earlier can be heard; a flock of birds flies overhead, away from the sound."
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Dipper,This is it! This is it!
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Dipper and Mabel,(Punching each other excitedly and walking towards the sound)Yes yes yes! Hoo hoo hoo!
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Soos,(Grabs a stick and follows them into the fog)

Real time, narrating:)My own son hasn't visited me in months!(Flashback moves to McGucket building the Gobblewonker. Real time, narrating)So I figured maybe I'd catch his fancy with a fifteen ton aquatic robut!(Laughs like a maniac and the flashback ends. Sighs)In retrospect, it seems a bit contrived. You just don't know the length us old-timers go through for a little quality time with our family."
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Dipper and Mabel,(Look at the fishing hats Grunkle Stan gave them and sigh)
The Legend of the Gobblewonker,Soos,"Dude. I guess the real lake monster is you two. Heh, heh! Sorry, that just like--boom--just popped into my head there."

Headhunters,Mabel,"We have an axe!(Shows Stan the ax in Dipper's bag; Making a horror movie screeching sound:)REE, REE, REE!"
Headhunters,Stan,"Hm, seems like the kind of thing a responsible parent wouldn't want you doing... Good thing I'm an uncle. Avenge me kids! AVENGE MEEE!!"
Headhunters,Narration,"Cut to the town, Dipper and Mabel are sneaking behind a dumpster near theSkull Fracture."
Headhunters,Dipper,This is the place.(Gasp whenTatslooks at him)Got the fake IDs?

Headhunters,Dipper,"10 o'clock, the time of the murder. So, I guess you've never seenthisbefore?(Pulls out the axe from his bag and shows Manly Dan)"
Headhunters,Manly Dan,"Listen, little girl!"
Headhunters,Dipper,"Hey, actually I'm a--"
Headhunters,Manly Dan,"I wouldn't pick my teeth with that ax. It's left handed! I only use my right hand, the MANLY HAND!!(Rips the machine's arm off and beats the machine with it)"
Headhunters,Tyler Cutebiker,Get 'im! Get 'im!(Giggles)
Headhunters,Dipper,Left handed...
Headhunters,Mabel and Biker,"(Looking at cootie catcher Mabel is counting off with)3, 4, 5, 6."
Headhunters,Mabel,(Gasps)Your wife is gonna be beautiful.
Headhunters,Biker,(Pumps arm)Yes!
Headhunters,Dipper,"Mabel, big break in the case!"
Headhunters,Dipper and Mabel,(Leave)
Headhunters,Biker,But will she love me?!
Headhunters,Dipper,"It's a left handed ax.(Shows her a list)These are all our suspects. Manly Dan is right handed, that means all we gotta do is find our left handed suspect and we've got our killer."
Headhunters,Mabel,"Oh man, we are onfiretoday! Pa-zow, Pa-zow, Pa-zow!"
Headhunters,Dipper,Let's find that murderer.(Fist bumps Mabel)
Headhunters,Narration,"Montage: cut to Mabel waving at McGucket. He has a baby alligator on his right hand as he waves back to her. Dipper lists McGucket as right handed.

Headhunters,Dipper,"(Gasps)Mabel, there's only one person left on this list."
Headhunters,Mabel,"(Gasps)Of course, it all adds up!"
Headhunters,Narration,The cops and kids go to Gravity Falls Gossiper.
Headhunters,Blubs,You kids better be right about this or you'll never get the end of it.
Headhunters,Dipper,The evidence is irrefutable.
Headhunters,Mabel,It'ssoirrefutable.
Headhunters,Durland,I'm gonna get to use my night stick!
Headhunters,Blubs,"You ready? You ready, little fella?"
Headhunters,Blubs and Durland,"Woo, woo!(Both poke each other with their police batons)"
Headhunters,Dipper,"On 3! 1, 2, ..."
Headhunters,Durland,(Smashes the door open)Yaaaahhhh!
Headhunters,Blubs,Nobody move! This is a raid!
Headhunters,Toby,Aaaahh!(Falls down)What is this? Some kind of raid?
Headhunters,Durland,(Smashes a lamp)Derp!
Headhunters,Dipper,"Toby Determined, you're under arrest for murder of the wax body of Grunkle Stan."
Headhunters,Mabel,You have the right to remain impressed with our awesome detective work.(High fives Dipper)
Headhunters,Toby,Gobbling goose feathers! I don't understand!
Headhunters,Dipper,"Then allow me to explain.(Flashback to the event; voiceover:)You were hoping that Grunkle Stan's new attraction would be the story that saved your failing newspaper. But when the show was a flop, you decided to go out and make your own headline.(In the flashback, Toby chops Wax Stan's head off)"
Headhunters,Mabel,(Holding a newspaper with a picture of Wax Stan's head)
Headhunters,Dipper,"(Flashback shows Toby's shoe with a hole in it and his turkey baster held in his left hand; voiceover:)But you were sloppy, and all the clues pointed to a shabby-shoed reporter who was caught left handed."
Headhunters,Mabel,"(Crumples up newspaper)Toby Determined, you're yesterday's news."
Headhunters,Toby,"Boy, your little knees must be sore... fromjumpingto conclusions. (Dances) Hachacha! I had nothing to do with that murder."
Headhunters,Dipper,"I knew it!(Overlapping with Mabel)Wait, what did you say? Nothing? You say nothing?"
Headhunters,Mabel,Huh? What? Could you repeat?
Headhunters,Blubs,Then where were you the night of the break-in?
Headhunters,Toby,"Ehh...(Inserts a tape into a TV. It starts playing, and we see him taking a cardboard cutout of Shandra Jimenez out of his closet)Finally, we can be alone, cardboard cutout of female news reporter Shandra Jimenez!(Kisses it)"
Headhunters,Cops and kids,Eeeewwww! Yuck!
Headhunters,Blubs,"Timestamp confirms it. Toby, you're off the hook. You freak of nature."
Headhunters,Toby,Hooray!
Headhunters,Dipper,"But, but it has to be him! Check the ax for fingerprints!"
Headhunters,Blubs,(Checks for finger print on the ax)No prints at all.
Headhunters,Dipper,No prints?
Headhunters,Durland,Hey I got a headline for you: city kids waste everyone's time.
Headhunters,Adults,(Laugh)
Headhunters,Dipper and Mabel,"(Look at each other, embarrassed)"
Headhunters,Toby,"(As the video of him kissing the cutout of Shandra Jimenez continues to play)Boy, I'd be pretty embarrassed if I was you two."
Headhunters,Narration,"Cut to Stan in the wax figure room. He is standing on a stage with a bunch of chairs set up. Dipper, Mabel, Soos, and the wax figures are the audience."
Headhunters,Stan,"Kids, Soos, lifeless wax figures, thank you all for coming."
Headhunters,Soos,"(Blows nose, crying)"
Headhunters,Stan,Some people might say it's wrong for a man to love a wax replica of himself.
Headhunters,Soos,(Jumps up and points)They're wrong!
Headhunters,Stan,"Easy Soos. Wax Stan, I hope you're picking pockets in wax heaven.(Wipes eye)I'm sorry, I got glitter in my eye!(Cries and runs away)"
Headhunters,Soos,"(Running after Stan, while crying:)Ohhhhh duuuude..."
Headhunters,Dipper,(Sighs)Those cops were right about me.
Headhunters,Mabel,"Dipper, we've come so far, we can't give up now."
Headhunters,Dipper,"(Stands up and walk to the coffin)But I considered everything: the weapon, the motive, the clues...(Looks inside coffin; sighs)Wax Stan's shoe has a hole in it..."
Headhunters,Mabel,All the wax guys have that. It's where the pole thingy attaches to their stand dealies.
Headhunters,Dipper,"Wait a minute, what has a hole on its shoes and no fingerprints? Mabel! The murderers are--"
Headhunters,Wax Holmes,Standing right behind you?
Headhunters,Narration,All the wax figures come to life.
Headhunters,Dipper,(Gasp)Wax Sherlock Holmes! Wax Shakespeare!Wax Coolio?

Headhunters,Wax figures,(Applaud)
Headhunters,Wax Holmes,"Uh, no that sounds too sincere. Slow clap."
Headhunters,Wax figures,(Slow clap)
Headhunters,Wax Holmes,"There we go, nice and condescending."
Headhunters,Dipper,But... how is this possible? You're made of wax!

Headhunters,Wax Holmes,(Laughs)Are we magic? She wants to know if we're magic!(Stops laughing)We're CURSED!

Headhunters,Wax Coolio,"Ahauntedgarage sale, son!"
Headhunters,Narration,Flashback to the haunted garage sale.
Headhunters,Seller,"I must warn you, these statues come at a terrible price."
Headhunters,Stan,(Looks at price tag)Twenty dollars?! I'll just take 'em when you're not lookin'.
Headhunters,Seller,What?
Headhunters,Stan,I said I was gonna rob you.
Headhunters,Narration,Flashback showing the wax museum during the day.

Headhunters,Stan,(Wakes up)Huh?
Headhunters,Narration,Wax Holmes and Poe freeze when Stan wakes up.
Headhunters,Stan,Eh.(Returns to sleep)
Headhunters,Wax Holmes,(Voiceover:)It was a charmed life for us cursed beings...
Headhunters,Narration,Flashback to Stan shaking the empty admission box and putting the wax figures in storage
Headhunters,Wax Holmes,"(Voiceover:)That is, until your uncle closed up shop."
Headhunters,Narration,"The storage room is seen wearing out as time goes by, leaving the door blocked by wallpaper. Soos later comes by sweeping the floor and finds the knob to the storage room. He puts the knob back in its place. Dissolve to the Mystery Shack."
Headhunters,Wax Holmes,(Voiceover:)We've been waiting ten years to get our revenge on Stan for locking us away...
Headhunters,Narration,Flashback to Wax Sherlock Holmes swipes Wax Stan's head off with an ax.
Headhunters,Wax Holmes,(Voiceover:)But we got the wrong guy.
Headhunters,Narration,"In the flashback, Stan grumbles and spits as he begins to enter and Wax Sherlock Holmes slips out; the flashback ends"
Headhunters,Dipper,So you were trying to murder Grunkle Stan forreal?!
Headhunters,Mabel,"You were right all along, Dipper! Wax peoplearecreepy!"
Headhunters,Wax Holmes,"Enough! Now that you know our secret, you must...die."
Headhunters,Narration,The wax figures growl and their eyes roll back in their heads. The approach the kids.
Headhunters,Mabel,"What do we do, what do we do?"
Headhunters,Dipper,I don't know!
Headhunters,Dipper and Mabel,(Throw stuff on a table behind them at the wax figures)
Headhunters,Dipper,(Throws a full coffee maker at them)
Headhunters,Wax Genghis Khan,"(Coffee all over him, he is melting; Screams)"
Headhunters,Mabel,That's it! We can melt them with hotty melty things!
Headhunters,Dipper and Mabel,(Grab the electric candles behind them and smile)
Headhunters,Dipper,Anyone move and we'll melt you into candles!
Headhunters,Mabel,Decorative candles!
Headhunters,Wax Holmes,You really think you can defeat us?
Headhunters,Dipper,I-I don't really know. I'm not-I'm not really sure.
Headhunters,Mabel,"It's worth a shot, I guess."
Headhunters,Wax Holmes,So be it...(To wax figures:)attack!
Headhunters,Narration,"The figures begin closing in on the twins. Wax Lizzie Borden swings her ax at Mabel, but accidently decapitatesWax Robin Hood. Mabel walks around her, butWax Shakespearesneaks up behind her. Mabel cuts off his hands with the candles, and he runs away. Wax Shakespeare's hands still move, and begin strangling Mabel.

Headhunters,Wax Larry King,My neck! My beautiful neck!
Headhunters,Wax Groucho Marx,(Touches candle and his his hand begins to melt)Eh!

Headhunters,Mabel,(Swings around Wax Coolio's head while getting overwhelmed by wax figures)

Headhunters,Mabel,Dipper! Watch out!
Headhunters,Dipper,(Cuts Wax Richard Nixon's leg; causes Nixon to be pushed into next room and sees Wax Sherlock Holmes approach him)
Headhunters,Wax Holmes,"Alright. Let's get this taken care of. (Puts Wax Stan's head on the horn of a rhino on the wall, and grabs a sword hanging on the wall. He then swings it at Dipper, smacking the candle out of his hand, and breaking it. He swings the sword above his head, and aims it at Dipper)"
Headhunters,Mabel,Catch! (Throws a poker to Dipper)
Headhunters,Narration,"Wax Holmes brings the sword on Dipper, but is blocked with the poker. Wax Sherlock keeps attacking, while Dipper blocks and is pushed back. Dipper is pushed back into the Attic Floor, and is cornered by Wax Holmes against the wall."
Headhunters,Wax Holmes,"Once your family is out of the way, we'll rule the night once again!"
Headhunters,Dipper,"(Looks at the window, and, just when Sherlock brings the sword down, rolls through his legs and out the window) Don't count on it!"
Headhunters,Wax Holmes,"Come back here, you brat!"
Headhunters,Narration,"Dipper climbs onto the Mystery Shack sign and Wax Holmes follows him. Dipper slowly walks across it, while Wax Holmes swings the sword at him. They clash between poker and sword while trying to maintain balance. Wax Holmes tries to hit Dipper with its sword, but Dipper jumps back, and the ""S"" in ""Shack"" falls off."
Headhunters,Wax Holmes,You really think you can outwit me boy? I'm Sherlock bleeding Holmes! Have you seen my magnifying glass?! It's enormous!
Headhunters,Dipper,"(Drops the poker and begins to climbs off the sign, and behind it. He hides behind the chimney and looks out to see is Wax Sherlock is there)"
Headhunters,Wax Holmes,(Kicks him down. Raises sword)Any last words?
Headhunters,Dipper,Um... you got any sunscreen?
Headhunters,Wax Holmes,Got any--? What?(Turns and sees the sun starting to rise; Gasps)No.(Begins to melt)
Headhunters,Dipper,"You know, letting me lead you outside? Probably not you sharpest decision."
Headhunters,Wax Holmes,"(Continues to melt)Outsmarted by a child in short pants! No!(Starts melting faster)Fiddlesticks! Humbugs! Tiiter, total kerfuffle. Butter hallabaloo.(Everything but his face melts)"
Headhunters,Dipper,Case closed!(Wipes hands together; the dust makes him sneeze)
Headhunters,Wax Holmes,"Ha ha ha! You sneeze like a kitten! Those policemen were right, you're adorable! Adorable!(Falls off the roof and then splashes)"
Headhunters,Dipper,E-ew.
Headhunters,Narration,Cut to Mabel throwing the remaining parts of the wax figures into the fireplace. Wax Shakespeare's head is the only noticeable wax figure left.
Headhunters,Wax Shakespeare,"Though our group be cleft in twain, man of wax shall rise again!"
Headhunters,Mabel,Y'know any limericks?
Headhunters,Wax Shakespeare,Uh... there once was a dude from Kentucky...
Headhunters,Mabel,Nope!(Throws his head into the fire)
Headhunters,Narration,Dipper enters.
Headhunters,Mabel,Dipper! You're okay! You solved the mystery after all.
Headhunters,Dipper,(Pulls up a chair and takes Wax Stan's head off the wall)I couldn't have done it without my sidekick.
Headhunters,Mabel,"No offense Dipper, but you're the sidekick."
Headhunters,Dipper,What? Says who? Have people been saying that? Have you heard that?
Headhunters,Stan,(Walks in)Hot Belgian waffles!! What happened to my parlor!?
Headhunters,Mabel,"Your wax figures turned out to be evil, so we fought them to the death!"
Headhunters,Dipper,I decapitated Larry King.
Headhunters,Stan,Ha ha! You kids and your imaginations!
Headhunters,Dipper,"On the bright side, though, look what we found.(Hands Stan Wax Stan's head)"
Headhunters,Stan,"My head! Ha ha! I missed this guy! You done good kids! Alright, line up for some affectionate noogie-ing."
Headhunters,Dipper,Oh I'm not so sure about that. Is there any other alternative...?
Headhunters,Mabel,Oh uh... I'm not so sure...
Headhunters,Stan,Ha ha!(Noogies Dipper and Mabel)
Headhunters,Mabel and Dipper,(Laugh)
Headhunters,Narration,Blubs and Durland drive up to the window.
Headhunters,Blubs,"Solved the case yet, boy? I'm so confident you're gonna say no, that I'm gonna take a long, slow sip from my cup of coffee.(Takes a long, slow sip)"
Headhunters,Dipper,"Actually, the answer is yes."
Headhunters,Blubs,Blu blu blu--(Spits coffee in Durland's face)
Headhunters,Durland,(Screams; spits coffee in Blubs' face)
Headhunters,Blubs,(Screams; spits coffee in Durland's face)

Headhunters,Dipper,"So, did you get rid of all the wax figures?"
Headhunters,Mabel,I am ninety-nine percent sure that I did!
Headhunters,Dipper,Good enough for me!
Headhunters,Narration,The camera moves over to a vent and we see Wax Larry King's head.
Headhunters,Wax Larry King,(Laughs)--Huh?
Headhunters,Rat,(Walks up to him)
Headhunters,Wax Larry King,So you're a rat. Tell me about that.
Headhunters,Rat,(Rips off his ear and runs off)
Headhunters,Wax Larry King,"Hey, get back here! (Hops after him) I'm hopping! I'm hopping after a rat that stole my ear!"
Headhunters,Narration,Cut to credits.
Headhunters,Mabel,"Hmm. Hey Dipper, which do you think is better? Sequins or llama hair?"

The Hand That Rocks the Mabel,Mabel,"No one, Grunkle Stan!"
The Hand That Rocks the Mabel,Gideon,"I appreciate your discretion. Now, Stan's no fan of mine. I don't know how a lemon so sour could be related to a peach so sweet."
The Hand That Rocks the Mabel,Mabel,Gideon! Aha ha!

The Hand That Rocks the Mabel,Wendy,"...Mike Worley, Nate Holt, oh, that guy with the tattoos..."
The Hand That Rocks the Mabel,Mabel,Maybe letting Dipper do it for me was a mistake. Gideon deserves an honest break up.

The Hand That Rocks the Mabel,Dipper,"(While choking:)Uh, Mabel!? This probably isn't the best time to be brutally honest with him!"

The Inconveniencing,Dipper,What? Are you guys serious?
The Inconveniencing,Wendy,Yeah! We're all gonna die! Chill out man. (punches Dipper friendly) It's not as bad as it looks.

The Inconveniencing,Robbie,"Oh yeah. I can't get in, but I'm sure Junior here is gonna break it down like Hercules."
The Inconveniencing,Wendy,"Come on, leave him alone. He's just a little kid."
The Inconveniencing,Dipper,(Walks around to dumpster; jumps up on it)
The Inconveniencing,Tambry,"Whoa, kid! What are you doing?"
The Inconveniencing,Dipper,(Walks up the roof to the vents; punches it)
The Inconveniencing,Mabel,"Go, Dipper! Punch that metal thing!"
The Inconveniencing,Dipper,(Walks inside the vent)

The Inconveniencing,Nate,Your new name is Dr. Funtimes.
The Inconveniencing,Mabel,(High fives Dipper)
The Inconveniencing,Wendy,(Punches Dipper friendly) Nice work.
The Inconveniencing,Dipper,(Skips inside after everyone else)
The Inconveniencing,Thompson,Do you guys really think it's haunted?
The Inconveniencing,Nate,"Nah! Thompson, are you kidding me?"
The Inconveniencing,Narration,"(The sign mysteriously turns from ""Yes, we're open"" to ""Get lost! We're closed."" Commercial break)"
The Inconveniencing,Wendy,"Whoa ho, man. it's even creepier than I imagined."

The Inconveniencing,Mabel,Jackpot!
The Inconveniencing,Dipper,"So, what are we going to do now?"
The Inconveniencing,Wendy,Anything we want.
The Inconveniencing,Narration,"(Everyone throws food at each other, Lee and Nate hit each other with bags full of cat litter, then, everyone sits in a circle and pop three mints into a Pit Cola bottle; it explodes and everyone cheers)"
The Inconveniencing,Mabel,(Runs around corner) Oh my gosh!Smile Dip! I thought this stuff was banned in America.
The Inconveniencing,Dipper,Maybe they had a good reason. (Gets hit by a balloon full of food. Runs off)
The Inconveniencing,Mabel,"(Puts the stick into the the Smile Dip. Looks at the stick, then pours the entire package into her mouth)"
The Inconveniencing,Narration,(Wendy and Dipper are eating ice pops on a shelf)
The Inconveniencing,Nate,"(Offscreen:) Hey, come here, man, we got it ready!"
The Inconveniencing,Thompson,"Whatever it is, I'll do it!"
The Inconveniencing,Wendy,"(Laughs) Thompson! Dipper, this night is like, legendary."
The Inconveniencing,Dipper,Really?
The Inconveniencing,Wendy,Just look around. The guys are bonding.
The Inconveniencing,Robbie and Nate,(Stuff ice into Thompson's pants)
The Inconveniencing,Wendy,I've never even seen Tambry look up from her phone this long.
The Inconveniencing,Tambry,(Looks up from her phone for a second)
The Inconveniencing,Wendy,And your sister seems to be going nuts with that Smile Dip.
The Inconveniencing,Mabel,Ugh... Maybe I've had too much. What do you think?
The Inconveniencing,Narration,"Cut to Mabel's hallucination, she is in a valley that changes colors, and crazy pop music plays in the background"
The Inconveniencing,Flavor pup,Elknurg...tsurtsid...tsum...
The Inconveniencing,Flavor pup #2,Would you like to eat my candy paws?
The Inconveniencing,Mabel,Of course you little angel. (Grabs the paw and chews it)
The Inconveniencing,Narration,Cut to real life; Mabel is chewing on air.
The Inconveniencing,Wendy,"You know Dipper, I wasn't sure if you could hang with our crew at first, but you're surprisingly mature for your age."
The Inconveniencing,Dipper,"Yes, yes I am. (Smears ice cream on face)"
The Inconveniencing,Lee,Hey guys! We need more ice! (Shows Lee shaking a bag of ice over Thompson's pants)
The Inconveniencing,Dipper,"I'm on it! (Jumps off the shelf and walks over to an ice freezer. He takes a bag of ice, but looks up to see some sort ofcooler monster) Aah! (Drops the ice and closes the door; he gasps and looks back at the door; he slowly opens the door again but the Cooler Monster is not there)"
The Inconveniencing,Lee,What was that? I thought I heard some lady screaming back here.
The Inconveniencing,Nate,"You freakin' out, kid?"
The Inconveniencing,Dipper,"Uh, no. I'm cool. Everything's cool."
The Inconveniencing,Robbie,Then what's all this about? (Points to the spilled ice)
The Inconveniencing,Dipper,"That's uh, um uh...hey look!Dancy Pants Revolution! The game that tricks people into exercising!"
The Inconveniencing,Teens,(Mumble in agreement and walks over to play it)
The Inconveniencing,Dipper,"Heh heh, yeah lets all- let's go play that. (Turns around and looks at the cooler's door. Then turns around again and walks to the video game)"
The Inconveniencing,Narration,"Cuts to Thompson playing Dancy Pants Revolution, and everyone cheering him on."
The Inconveniencing,Dancy Pants,Dance! Hurry up!
The Inconveniencing,Lee and Nate,Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
The Inconveniencing,Wendy,Wow. He's really terrible at this.
The Inconveniencing,Dipper,"Heh heh, yeah. That's, that's great. (Looks into a glass door, and sees the reflections of Wendy, Robbie, Tambry, Thompson and himself. Their skin, however, is replaced by bones, Dipper rubs his eyes and everything is back to normal) I'll be right back. (Runs off to use a telephone) Come on, Grunkle Stan, pick up! Ugh, what is he doing!?"
The Inconveniencing,Narration,Cuts to Stan watching The Duchess Approves
The Inconveniencing,Duchess,"I don't care about Dukes, or Commoners, or His Royal Highness Lionel of Cornwall! I'm not afraid anymore, Mother!"
The Inconveniencing,Mother,"Duchess, I forbid you."
The Inconveniencing,Stan,(Eats ice cream)
The Inconveniencing,Duchess,"I may be a Duchess, but...I'm also a woman! (Takes her hat off to reveal her very long beautiful hair flying in the wind)"
The Inconveniencing,Stan,Yes! Yes! In your face Elizabeth! It's just like my life!...in a way.
The Inconveniencing,Narration,Cuts to the phone hanging from the cord and Dipper walking over to Mabel.
The Inconveniencing,Dipper,"Mabel, I need your advice. We're hanging out in a haunted convenience store, I can't get a hold of Grunkle Stan, and if I try to say anything about it to any of these guys they'll just think I'm a scared little kid or something!"
The Inconveniencing,Mabel,"(Makes a gurgling sound with Smile Dip all over her face, clothes, and her eyes small and green)"
The Inconveniencing,Dipper,Mabel?
The Inconveniencing,Narration,"Zoom in on Mabel's face, fade to her hallucination: she's flying with the crazy pop music from before playing"
The Inconveniencing,Mabel,The future! ...is in the past! OnwardsAoshima!
The Inconveniencing,Aoshima,"(Moves its fists in a circular motion. Its now two mouths open to reveal a fist coming out of each of them, and the fists open out & spit out rainbows)"
The Inconveniencing,Narration,Cut to real life.
The Inconveniencing,Dipper,(Shakes Mabel) Mabel! How many of these did you eat!?
The Inconveniencing,Mabel,Beleven.. teen...
The Inconveniencing,Dipper,"Oh man. (Drops Mabel) Oh man, oh man, oh man."
The Inconveniencing,Robbie,"(Uses a quarter to scratch lottery tickets) Ha! Ha ha ha! (Drops the coin and it rolls onto the floor and stops in front of a white line; goes to pick it up but stops) Whoa guys, you might wanna see this."
The Inconveniencing,Everyone except Mabel,"(Gather around the tape markings ofPaandMa's bodies, talking to each other)"
The Inconveniencing,Lee,Whoa. Then the rumors are true!
The Inconveniencing,Dipper,(Gulps)
The Inconveniencing,Robbie,"(To Lee:) Dude, I dare you to lie down in it."
The Inconveniencing,Lee,Good idea! (To Nate:) Go lie down in it!
The Inconveniencing,Nate,"I'm a dead body, look! (Walks over to the markings)"
The Inconveniencing,Dipper,Wait! Maybe let's not do that.
The Inconveniencing,Lee,This guy's scared!
The Inconveniencing,Dipper,"All I'm saying is, why tempt the fates? I mean... What if this place really is... haunted?"
The Inconveniencing,Teens,Boo! Ah c'mon!
The Inconveniencing,Robbie,"Yeah, just take it down a notch, Captain Buzzkill!"
The Inconveniencing,Dipper,I thought I was Dr. Funtimes.
The Inconveniencing,Robbie,"Well, you're acting like Captain Buzzkill! Right?"
The Inconveniencing,"Tambry, Lee and Nate",(Nod)
The Inconveniencing,Wendy,"Yeah, little bit."
The Inconveniencing,Tambry,(Texting:) Status update: trapped in store with insane 9-year old.
The Inconveniencing,Dipper,I'm not a 9-year-old! (lies down in tape markings) I'm 13! Technically a teen!
The Inconveniencing,Narration,The tape markings light up and the lights go out. Tambry looks up and dissolves.
The Inconveniencing,Dipper,"(Picks up her phone, reading from it:) Status update: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!"

The Inconveniencing,Lee,I don't know man! I don't know!
The Inconveniencing,Robbie,Let's just go already!
The Inconveniencing,Wendy,Thompson!
The Inconveniencing,Thompson,(Playing Dancy Pants Revolution)Wait! I've almost got the high score! (dissolves and reappears inside the game) Uh? What?
The Inconveniencing,Dancy Pants,It's time to shake what your mama gave you!
The Inconveniencing,Thompson,No! So many arrows!
The Inconveniencing,Dancy Pants,(Throws arrows down on Thompson) You're a dance machine!
The Inconveniencing,Thompson,No!You'rea dance machine! (Cries)
The Inconveniencing,Dipper,Oh no!

The Inconveniencing,Wendy,"What the... (tries to open the door but can't) Guys, It's locked!"
The Inconveniencing,Robbie,"OUTTA MY WAY! (Throws the cash register at the doors, but it dissolves and green light flies at Robbie)"
The Inconveniencing,Dipper,"Everybody, wait! Whatever is doing this has to have some kind of reason! (opensJournal 3) Maybe if we could just figure out what it is, they'll let us out of here!"
The Inconveniencing,Robbie,"""Uh-uh, they'll let us out of here!"" (Sarcastically:) Yeah, that makes a lot of sense!"
The Inconveniencing,Wendy,"I don't know guys, maybe he's got a point!"
The Inconveniencing,Lee,"(Sarcastically:) Yeah right, I'm sure the ghost just wants to talk about his feelings. (Screams as he dissolves and reappears on a cereal box) W-what?"
The Inconveniencing,Cereal Box Toucan,I'm bonkers for eating you alive! (Holds up a spoon)
The Inconveniencing,Lee,No! (Screams as a stabbing sound is heard)
The Inconveniencing,Nate,"Lee! Okay, okay... I'm with you, kid! 100%, man!"
The Inconveniencing,Pa,"(Possessing Mabel, flies up behind counter; through Mabel, deep voice:) Welcome."
The Inconveniencing,"Dipper, Nate, Robbie, and Wendy",(Scream)
The Inconveniencing,Dipper,They got Mabel!
The Inconveniencing,Pa,"Welcome to your graves, young trespassers. (Kicks legs and laughs)"
The Inconveniencing,Wendy,W-we're super sorry for hanging out in your store!
The Inconveniencing,Dipper,Yeah! Can we just go now and leave forever?
The Inconveniencing,Pa,"Well, okay. You're free to go. (Opens doors) But before you leave, hot dogs are now half off. I know it might be crazy, but you gotta try these dogs!"
The Inconveniencing,Nate and Robbie,(Scream and run for the door)
The Inconveniencing,Pa,(Closes doors) Just kidding about the hot dog sale!
The Inconveniencing,Nate,Just let us out of here already!
The Inconveniencing,Pa,I don't like your tone! (Dissolves Nate)
The Inconveniencing,Nate,(Reappears as a hot dog on the stove) No! I'M A HOT DOG!
The Inconveniencing,Pa,It begins. (Makes everything float to the ceiling) Welcome to your home for all eternity!
The Inconveniencing,Wendy,"Dipper, what do we do?!"
The Inconveniencing,Dipper,DUCK!
The Inconveniencing,Dipper and Wendy,(Duck to avoid a flying shelf)
The Inconveniencing,Wendy,"(Points) Quick, in there!"
The Inconveniencing,Dipper and Wendy,(Run to a tipped over ice machine and hide inside and pant)
The Inconveniencing,Wendy,What do they want from us?!
The Inconveniencing,Dipper,"Revenge, I guess?"
The Inconveniencing,Wendy,What did we do wrong?
The Inconveniencing,Dipper,"Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. Why was each person taken? Tambry was texting, Thompson was playing a video game, Lee was being sarcastic; it doesn't make any sense!"
The Inconveniencing,Wendy,"Yeah! I mean, those are all just normal teenage things."
The Inconveniencing,Dipper,"... Wendy, say that last part again."
The Inconveniencing,Wendy,Normal teenage things?
The Inconveniencing,Dipper,Of course! Stay here until I get back! (crawls out of the freezer)
The Inconveniencing,Wendy,"Dude, what are you doing?!"
The Inconveniencing,Dipper,Hey ghost!
The Inconveniencing,Pa,"(twists Mabel's head around to face Dipper, then turns the rest of her body towards him)"
The Inconveniencing,Dipper,I've got something to tell you! (makes Dipper float in the air) I'm not a teenager!
The Inconveniencing,Pa,"(drops everything that's floating and appears holding Mabel by her hair with Ma) Hohoho! Well, why didn't you say so? (drops Mabel into a pile of candy)"
The Inconveniencing,Mabel,(Falling:) WAAH! (Lands in the candy and holds her head) Ohhh...
The Inconveniencing,Pa,How old did you say you were?
The Inconveniencing,Dipper,I'm... (Reluctantly:) I'm twelve. Technically not a teen.
The Inconveniencing,Ma,"When we were alive, teenagers were a scourge on our store!"
The Inconveniencing,Pa,"Always sassafrassin' costumers with their boomy boxes and disrespectful short pants! (Flashbacks to the 1990s when he and Ma died) So we decided to up and ban them. (Pa in the flashback places a sign labeled ""NO TEENS"" on the store window) But they retaliated with this new fangled rap music!"
The Inconveniencing,Ma,"(In the flashback, hugs Pa) The lyrics, they were so, hateful!"
The Inconveniencing,1990s Teens,"(In the flashback, dancing to the rap:) Homework's whack, and so are rules! Tuckin' in your shirts for fools!"
The Inconveniencing,Pa,(In the flashback:)NO!
The Inconveniencing,Ma,"It was so shocking, we were stricken down with double heart attacks!"
The Inconveniencing,Ma and Pa,"(In the flashback, clutch their chests and collapse, dead)"
The Inconveniencing,Narration,The flashback ends
The Inconveniencing,Ma,"(Brightly:) That's why we hate teenagers so much. Don't we, honey?"
The Inconveniencing,Ma and Pa,(Nose nuzzle)
The Inconveniencing,Dipper,"But they're my friends, isn't there anything I can do to, help them?"
The Inconveniencing,Pa,There is one thing. Do you know any funny little dances?
The Inconveniencing,Dipper,Uh... is there anythingelseI can do?
The Inconveniencing,Pa,(Lights himself on fire) NOOOO!
The Inconveniencing,Dipper,"OKAY OKAY OKAY! Um... Well, I do know... (Reluctantly:) the Lamby Lamby Dance. But, uh, but I can't really do it without a lamb costume. (Folds his arms, happy to be out of it)"
The Inconveniencing,Pa,(Snaps his fingers and Dipper is in a lamb costume)
The Inconveniencing,Dipper,"Oh, well... there it is. (Takes a deep breath, sings theLamby Lamby Dance) Wellll...Who wants a lamby lamby lamby? I do! I do! So go up and greet your mammy mammy mammy!
Hi there! Hi there!
So march march march around the daisies... (Wendy smiles; this is the cutest thing she had ever seen)"
The Inconveniencing,Pa,"Yes, Yes! More! MORE!"
The Inconveniencing,Dipper,"(Marching and singing:) Don't don't don't you forget about the baby! (Sweats, winks)"
The Inconveniencing,Pa,"That was so fine, girly dancin' boy! Your friends are free."
The Inconveniencing,Dipper,"(In normal clothes) Well I don't think you have to worry about us coming back, so..."
The Inconveniencing,Ma and Pa,(Disappear and allow everything to fall back to the floor and freeing the teens)
The Inconveniencing,Mabel,Ugghhh... I'm never gonna eat or do anything ever again.

Dipper vs. Manliness,Multi-bear and Dipper,(Singing:)That girl is you! Oo-oo o-oo!
Dipper vs. Manliness,Dipper,(Laughs)This is crazy! Finally someone who-who understands- uh.. Oh yeah. I guess I'm suppose to kill you? Or I'll never be a man?
Dipper vs. Manliness,Multi-bear,I accept my fate.
Dipper vs. Manliness,Dipper,No!(Pause)Really?
Dipper vs. Manliness,Multi-bear,It's for the best.
Dipper vs. Manliness,Dipper,(Raises his spear but it hits the floor of the mancave.)I'm not gonna do it.
Dipper vs. Manliness,Leaderaur,You were told! The price of manhood is the multi-bear's head!
Dipper vs. Manliness,Dipper,"Listen, Leaderaur, alright? You too, Tesosteraur, Pubertaur, and.. I don't know, whatever you're name is. B-Beardy."
Dipper vs. Manliness,Beardy,It's Beardy.
Dipper vs. Manliness,Dipper,"You keep telling me that being a man means doing all these tasks, and being aggro all the time, but I'm starting to think that stuff's malarkey."
Dipper vs. Manliness,Narration,The manotaurs gasp.
Dipper vs. Manliness,Dipper,"You heard me, malarkey. So maybe I don't have muscles, or hair in certain places, and.. sure, when a girly pop song comes on the radio, sometimes, I leave it on! 'Cause dang it, top 40 hits are in the top 40 for a reason! They're catchy!"
Dipper vs. Manliness,Chutzpar,Destructor.. What are you saying?
Dipper vs. Manliness,Dipper,I'm saying the Multi-bear is a really nice guy. And you're bunch of jerks if you want me to cut off his head!
Dipper vs. Manliness,Leaderaur,(Stands up and destroys the spear)Kill the multi-bear or never be a man!
Dipper vs. Manliness,Dipper,Then I guess I'll never be a man.
Dipper vs. Manliness,Chutzpar,Boooo! Weak!
Dipper vs. Manliness,Manotaurs,Boooooo! Lame! Boooo!
Dipper vs. Manliness,Chutzpar,Hey guys! Who wants to go build something and knock it down?!
Dipper vs. Manliness,Narration,"The manotaurs cheer and leave, chanting ""Man!"" several times. Dipper kicks a rock away and walks away. Cut to Greasy' Diner."
Dipper vs. Manliness,Lazy Susan,(Hitting pie trolley)SPIN! SPIN!
Dipper vs. Manliness,Mabel,"(Enters with Stan) Lazy Susan. Listen: I know he's not much to look at, but you're always fixing stuff in the diner, and if you like fixing stuff, nothing can use more fixing than my Grunkle Stan! Also women live longer than men so your dating pool is smaller and you should really lower your standards."
Dipper vs. Manliness,Stan,"So, Lazy Susan, what do you say?"
Dipper vs. Manliness,Lazy Susan,(Leaves)
Dipper vs. Manliness,Stan,Uhhhh...(Walks away)
Dipper vs. Manliness,Lazy Susan,(Comes back with a piece of paper and a piece of pie)Heeeeyyyy! Here's my number. Why don't you give me a call some time?
Dipper vs. Manliness,Stan,Really?!
Dipper vs. Manliness,Lazy Susan,REALLY!! HAHA. Also: here's some pie. On the house. For YOU!(leaves)
Dipper vs. Manliness,Mabel,EEEEEEEEEEEEE!!! We did it! When are you gonna call? You wanna call now? I don't have a phone. Let's buy a phone! We can put it on a credit card. Let's get a credit card.
Dipper vs. Manliness,Stan,"Mabel! Let a man enjoy his pie, huh?"
Dipper vs. Manliness,Dipper,(Comes up to the restaurant)
Dipper vs. Manliness,Mabel,"DIPPER!! It's me, Mabel! I'm looking at you through this glass! Right here! This is my voice! I'm talking to you from inside!"
Dipper vs. Manliness,Dipper,"(Nods and gives Mabel a ""Calm down"" sign. Comes inside)"
Dipper vs. Manliness,Mabel,Did you see me through the-?
Dipper vs. Manliness,Dipper,Yes.
Dipper vs. Manliness,Mabel,What's wrong?
Dipper vs. Manliness,Dipper,I don't want to talk about it.
Dipper vs. Manliness,Stan,Good.
Dipper vs. Manliness,Dipper,It's just these half man half bull humanoids were hanging out with me...
Dipper vs. Manliness,Stan,Here we go.
Dipper vs. Manliness,Dipper,"But then they wanted me to do this really tough, horrible thing but it just wasn't right. So I said no."
Dipper vs. Manliness,Stan,You were your own man and you stood up for yourself.
Dipper vs. Manliness,Dipper,Huh?
Dipper vs. Manliness,Stan,"Well, you did what was right even though no one agreed with ya. Sounds pretty manly to me, but what do I know?"
Dipper vs. Manliness,Dipper,(Smiles)
Dipper vs. Manliness,Mabel,"Wait a minute, do my eyes deceive me? You have a chest hair!"
Dipper vs. Manliness,Dipper,"(Checks his chest and gasp)You're right! I do! Ha ha, this is amazing! I really do! Take that, man tester! Take that, Pituitor!"
Dipper vs. Manliness,Stan,Pituitor?
Dipper vs. Manliness,Dipper,This guy has chest hair!
Dipper vs. Manliness,Mabel,(pulls it out and puts it in a journal)Scrap-book ortunity!
Dipper vs. Manliness,Stan,"Don't worry, kid, if you're anything like me, there's more where that came from.(rips open his shirt)"
Dipper vs. Manliness,Dipper,"OH, GROSS!!!"
Dipper vs. Manliness,Everyone,HAHAHAHAHA!
Dipper vs. Manliness,Dipper,"Seriously, that's disgusting."
Dipper vs. Manliness,Narration,Stinger: Stan is sitting on the chair next to the phone. The phone rings.
Dipper vs. Manliness,Stan,"Oh, not again!"
Dipper vs. Manliness,Answering machine,Message number: 36
Dipper vs. Manliness,Lazy Susan,"(over answering machine:)Hey, handsome! It's me, Lazy Susan, calling to say hi: Hi! My cats also wanted to say hi! Say hi, Donald!"
Dipper vs. Manliness,Donald,(over answering machine:)Meow
Dipper vs. Manliness,Lazy Susan,"(over answering machine.)Good, Sandy, you say hi!"
Dipper vs. Manliness,Sandy,(over answering machine)Meow
Dipper vs. Manliness,Lazy Susan,"(over answering machine)Mr. Cat-face, now it's your turn to say-"
Dipper vs. Manliness,Mr. Cat-face,(over answering machine)MOOWW!!!!!
Dipper vs. Manliness,Lazy Susan,(over answering machine)Mr. Cat-face!
Dipper vs. Manliness,Mr. Cat-face,(over answering machine)MEEEEEOWW!!!!
Dipper vs. Manliness,Lazy Susan,"(over answering machine)Well, anyway call me! Call me back!(hangs up)"
Dipper vs. Manliness,Stan,How do I get out of this?!
Double Dipper,Narration,The episode begins withSoosandWendypreparing for aparty.MabelandDipperare sitting on a couch.
Double Dipper,Dipper Pines,"Oh no, Mabel. I-I don't feel so good. I-BBBBLLLAAAA!(Sprays Silly String at Mabel)"
Double Dipper,Mabel Pines,"Ohhh,Grunkle Stan, what did you feed us?! BBBBBLLLAAAA!(Sprays Silly String at Dipper)"
Double Dipper,Dipper,BBBBLLLAAAA!(Sprays Silly String)
Double Dipper,Mabel,BBBBLLLAAAA!(Sprays Silly String)
Double Dipper,Dipper,BBBBLLLAAA!(Sprays Silly String)
Double Dipper,Mabel,"Hahaha, barfing!"
Double Dipper,Wendy Corduroy,"(Runs up)Guys, guys, stop! Something terrible just happened!"
Double Dipper,Dipper and Mabel,(Stare at Wendy)
Double Dipper,Wendy,BBBBLLLAAAA!(Sprays Silly String at the twins. They all laugh hysterically)
Double Dipper,Mabel,(Throws confetti)Comedy gold!
Double Dipper,Stan Pines,"(Takes Silly String cans and confetti)Alright, alright! Party supplies are now off-limits."
Double Dipper,Soos Ramirez,"Mr. Pines, whose birthday is it again?"
Double Dipper,Stan,"Nobody's. Thought this party might be a good way to get kids to spend money at the Shack. (Unrolls a ""Pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey"" game)"
Double Dipper,Soos,Nice!
Double Dipper,Stan,The young people of this town want fun; I'll smother 'em with fun!
Double Dipper,Dipper,(Pouring Mabel some Diet Pitt Peach Soda)Maybe comments like that are why kidsdon'tgo to the Mystery Shack.
Double Dipper,Stan,"Hey, hey! Hows about you make yourself useful and copy these flyers?(Shows Dipper and Mabel a flyer)"
Double Dipper,Mabel,"Oh boy, a trip to the copier store!"
Double Dipper,Soos,"Calendars, mugs, t-shirts and more! They got it all at the copier store! That's not their slogan, I just really feel that way about the copier store."
Double Dipper,Stan,Save the trouble. You know the oldcopierin my office? I finally fixed the old girl up! Good as new!
Double Dipper,Narration,"Dipper and Mabel are in Stan's office. They pull the sheet off the old, busted up copier machine. Several moths fly around it."
Double Dipper,Mabel,(Gasps)Butterflies!
Double Dipper,Dipper,"(Lifts the lid up)Does it even work?(Presses a button, then rests his arm on the machine. It turns on, and creates a copy of his arm)"
Double Dipper,Mabel,(Picks up the paper)Success!(Notices the paper shaking and drops it)Whoa!
Double Dipper,Narration,The picture of Dipper's arm comes to life and begins to crawl near them.
Double Dipper,Mabel and Dipper,AH!
Double Dipper,Dipper,"Stay back!(Throws Mabel's soda at the arm, disintegrating it)Oh my gosh! Mabel, I think this copier can copy human beings!"
Double Dipper,Mabel,Do you realize what this means? (Pauses) BBBBLLLAAAA!!(Sprays Silly String at Dipper)
Double Dipper,Narration,Cut totheme song.
Double Dipper,Narration,"Stan addresses Soos, Wendy, Mabel, and Dipper, who are all standing side-by-side."
Double Dipper,Stan,"Alright party people... and Dipper. Let's talk business. Soos, because you'll work for free, and you begged, I'm lettin' you be DJ."
Double Dipper,Soos,"You won't regret it, Mr. Pines. I got this book to teach me how to DJ R-R-Right!(Holds upbook)"
Double Dipper,Stan,"Not encouraging. Wendy, you and Mabel are working the ticket stand."
Double Dipper,Mabel,"What? But Grunkle Stan, this party is my chance to make new friends!"
Double Dipper,Dipper,I... I could work with Wendy.
Double Dipper,Stan,"(Rolls eyes)You realize if you do, you gotta commit to staying at the ticket stand with Wendy. No getting out of it, just the two of you,alone, all night."
Double Dipper,Dipper,"(Watches Wendy spray Soos' belly with Silly String, smiles)I promise.(Cut to Dipper standing in front of a mirror in his room putting on a bow tie; he turns to get the spray and sees Mabel there)AH!(Turns)What?"
Double Dipper,Mabel,"(Pretending to be Dipper:)Uh, uh, I could work the counter with you, Wendy! Let's kiss!(Pretends to kiss someone)"
Double Dipper,Dipper,"Yeah, yeah. Laugh all you want, but I devised a plan to make sure my night with Wendy goes perfect.(Makes clicking noise)"
Double Dipper,Mabel,"Plan? Oh, you're not making one of those overcomplicated listy things, are you?"
Double Dipper,Dipper,"Psh. Over complicated? Let me just... (unfolds a huge list)alright, fold that there, kay. Step 1: Getting to know each with playful banter. Banter is like talking but smarter."
Double Dipper,Mabel,That sounds like a dumb idea for poopheads.
Double Dipper,Dipper,"Yeah, see? This isn't banter. This is what I want to avoid with Wendy. The final step is to ask her to dance.(Imagines a taller version of himself and Wendy dancing)"
Double Dipper,Wendy,Oh Dipper! I'm so happy you decided to work the ticket stand with me; you're so organized. Show me that checklist again.
Double Dipper,Dipper,(Pulls out checklist from pocket)
Double Dipper,Wendy,Oh!
Double Dipper,Dipper,"(Real life:)If I follow steps 1 through 11, nothing can get in my way!"
Double Dipper,Mabel,"Dipper, you're the one getting in your way. Why can't you just walk up and talk to her like a normal person?"
Double Dipper,Dipper,"Step 9, sister!(Points to Step 9, which is ""talk to her like a normal person."")"
Double Dipper,Mabel,(Sighs and rolls her eyes)
Double Dipper,Narration,The party begins. Stan walks over to Mabel.
Double Dipper,Stan,"(Singing:)Yadda dee, yada doo, yada doo.(Talking:)Can your uncle throw a party or what?"
Double Dipper,Soos,"(As DJ:)The energy, it's electric! Uhh, lightning,(presses buttons on sound FX machine, making various noises)lightning, lightning, lightning..."
Double Dipper,Stan,"And if anyone wants to leave, I'm charging an exit fee of 15 bucks!"
Double Dipper,Nate,(Counting money with Lee)We've only got 13!
Double Dipper,Lee,We're trapped!
Double Dipper,Lee and Nate,(Pound on window)
Double Dipper,Narration,"Outside, Wendy and Dipper are working at the ticket station."
Double Dipper,Dipper,(To himself:)Step 1: Casual banter.(To Wendy:)SO HERE'S A CASUAL QUESTION!(coughs)What's your favorite type of snack food?
Double Dipper,Wendy,"Oh, man! I can't just pick one!"
Double Dipper,Dipper,NO way! Mine too!
Double Dipper,Wendy,"Wait, what?"
Double Dipper,Dipper,Uhh... I mean... I mean... (Stuffs a bunch of popcorn in his mouth; to himself:)New topic! New topic!(Coughs)
Double Dipper,Mabel,"(Inside, dancing)Go, go! Work it, work it!(Sits down next toGrenda; opens a plastic water bottle and drinks some; she sees Grenda's lizard)Wow! You've got an animal on your body! I'm Mabel."
Double Dipper,Grenda Grendinator,"Hi, I'm Grenda. (Gestures to Candy, in the chair next to her)This isCandy."
Double Dipper,Candy Chiu,(Waves to Mabel; there are forks taped on her fingers)
Double Dipper,Mabel,Why do you have forks taped to your fingers?
Double Dipper,Candy,(Puts her hand into Grenda's bowl of popcorn; when she pulls it out each finger has some popcorn on it)Improvement of human being.
Double Dipper,Candy and Grenda,(Watch Grenda's lizard eat some popcorn and laugh)
Double Dipper,Mabel,I've found my people!
Double Dipper,Soos,"Remember dudes,(reading from book)who ever, um, party hardies, what? Gets the party crown!(Holds up crown)Most applause at the end of the night wins!"
Double Dipper,Grenda and Candy,Wow!
Double Dipper,Pacifica Northwest,"(Walks up to Soos with herfriends)Party crown? I'll take that, thank you very much!"
Double Dipper,Mabel,Who's that?
Double Dipper,Candy,"The most popular girl in town, Pacifica Northwest."
Double Dipper,Grenda,I always feel bad about myself around her.
Double Dipper,Soos,I can't just give you the crown. It's sort of a competition thing.
Double Dipper,Pacifica,"(Laughs and picks up microphone)Honestly, who's gonna compete against me? Fork girl? Lizard lady? (Laughs)"
Double Dipper,Grenda,"Hold me, Candy! (Hugs Candy)"
Double Dipper,Candy,Our kind isn't welcome here!
Double Dipper,Mabel,"(Walks angrily over to Soos; pops up from behind table; happily:)Hey, I'll compete!"
Double Dipper,Candy and Grenda,(Gasp)
Double Dipper,Mabel,(To Pacifica:)I'm Mabel.
Double Dipper,Pacifica,That sounds like a fat old lady's name.
Double Dipper,Mabel,I'll take that as a compliment!
Double Dipper,Pacifica,May the better partier win.(Menacingly walks away with her friends)
Double Dipper,Mabel,(To Pacifica:)Nice meeting you!(To Grenda and Candy:)She's going down.
Double Dipper,Wendy,(Looks at party through window)Whoa! Sounds like the party's getting nuts.
Double Dipper,Soos,"Let the battle for the party crown begin! Mabel comes out strong! Watch out, Pacifica!"
Double Dipper,Wendy,I've gotta get in there!(To Dipper:)Cover for me?
Double Dipper,Dipper,"Umm... well I, um–"
Double Dipper,Wendy,"Thanks, man!(Goes inside and dances)"
Double Dipper,Dipper,(To the crowd of people waiting to get tickets:)I'll be back shortly! (To himself:)Sure Stan won't mind if I'm gone for a few minutes.(Turns to run inside)
Double Dipper,Stan,"(Grabs Dipper by the back of his shirt)Hey! What are you doing, kid? These suckers aren't gonna rip themselves off!"
Double Dipper,Kid,Yeah!
Double Dipper,Stan,"You promised, remember?"
Double Dipper,Dipper,I did?
Double Dipper,Stan,(Plays a tape recording of Dipper's promise)
Double Dipper,Dipper's voice,I promise.
Double Dipper,Stan,(Walks off step by step and suddenly goes back for checking)
Double Dipper,Wendy,Woo-hoo-hoo!
Double Dipper,Dipper,"If only I could be two places at once.(Goes into Stan's office, lies down on the copy machine and presses the copy button)I wonder if this is a good idea."
Double Dipper,Narration,"Dipper is copied. The paper with the copy of him falls to the ground. It ripples, and the Dipper clone comes to life."
Double Dipper,Dipper,Whoa! ...I have a really big head.
Double Dipper,Dipper and Clone,"So, uh...(Chuckles)sorry, you first. Stop copying me!(Laugh)"
Double Dipper,Clone,"(Tries to slap his leg but hits his elbow on the copy machine)Ow, ow! Funny bone!"
Double Dipper,Dipper,(Writes the number 2 on the clone's head)I will call you: Number 2.
Double Dipper,Number 2,Definitely not. You know a name I've always wanted?
Double Dipper,Dipper and Number 2,Tyrone?
Double Dipper,Dipper,"Okay, Tyrone. Let's get down to business. I'm thinking you cover me at the ticket stand, while I ask Wendy to dance."
Double Dipper,Tyrone,"I know the plan, buddy."
Double Dipper,Dipper and Tyrone,(Pull out Dipper's plan)
Double Dipper,Dipper,"(Backs away from Tyrone)Hey, we're not gonna get jealous and turn on each other like the clones in the movies, are we?"
Double Dipper,Tyrone,"Dipper, please. This is you you're talking about. Plus, hey!(Snaps his fingers)You can always just disintegrate with me with water."
Double Dipper,Dipper and Tyrone,(Tap their heads)Yeeah...(Tap each other's heads)Yeeeeah!
Double Dipper,Narration,Tyrone mans the ticket station while Dipper is inside. They give each other the thumbs up. Dipper then walks over to Wendy.
Double Dipper,Dipper,"Great news, Wendy! I got somebody to cover the concessions for me!"
Double Dipper,Wendy,That's awesome. You can hang out with me andRobbie. Robbie you remember Dipper from the convenience store?
Double Dipper,Robbie Valentino,"Uh, no. Yo, Wendy, check out my new guitar.(Plays guitar)"
Double Dipper,Wendy,"Whoa, cool!"
Double Dipper,Dipper,(Gasps and then imagines Robbie and Wendy dancing)
Double Dipper,Wendy,"Robbie, you're a stupid, arrogant fraud; but kiss me anyway because you can play guitar. Oh wait, I forgot something.(Walks over and punches Dipper; to Robbie:) LET'S GET MARRIED TONIGHT!"
Double Dipper,Tyrone,"(Calls Dipper)Hey buddy it's me, you. I just had the same jealousy fantasy."
Double Dipper,Dipper,We got to get rid of Robbie if I ever want to dance with Wendy!
Double Dipper,Wendy,"Hey, Dipper! We're gonna go sit on the couch! Meet us when you're done."
Double Dipper,Dipper,Oh no! They're sitting on the couch! We gotta think of something quick!(sees Robbie's bike)I got an idea!
Double Dipper,Tyrone,I got the same one. But we're gonna need some help.
Double Dipper,Dipper,"(Cut to Stan's office, where he is writing the number 3 on a third clone's hat)And that's where you come in number three!"
Double Dipper,Number 3,But what if Robbie catches me? I'll be all alone!
Double Dipper,Tyrone,"Yeah, makes a good point."
Double Dipper,Dipper,"Okay, one more. Good point. Four Dippers. This is a four Dipper plan.(Makes another copy of himself)"
Double Dipper,Narration,The machine jams.
Double Dipper,Tyrone,"Uh-oh, paper jam. (Pulls the paper out of the machine and screams as it comes to life)"
Double Dipper,Paper Jam Dipper,(Rising out of the paper and attacking Tyrone)NYANYANYANYANYA-NAAAAA-NAAAAA. AAXUXAASSUAA-AAAA.
Double Dipper,Number 3,"C'mon, you're not gonna make me partner up withhim, are you?"
Double Dipper,Tyrone,"(To Number 3:)SSSHH! Don't be rude.(To Paper Jam Dipper:)Hey, buddy hey. It's okay."
Double Dipper,Paper Jam Dipper,AAAA-KKKKKKKXXX-KKKKXXX-A.
Double Dipper,Dipper,Okay. Just one more clone.
Double Dipper,Narration,Cut to Pacifica on a stage.
Double Dipper,Pacifica,"(Singing:)Always means forever(closes eyes), ALWAAAAAYYYSS!(her high voice breaks a plastic cup; whispering and points)Forever."
Double Dipper,Grenda,"I used to sing like that, before my voice changed."
Double Dipper,Soos,Pacifica pulls ahead!
Double Dipper,Pacifica,"Try and top that!(Hands Mabel the microphone)Oh, Grenda, by the way, you sound like a professional wrestler."
Double Dipper,Grenda,I WANNA PUT HER IN A HEADLOCK AND MAKE HER FEEL PAIN!
Double Dipper,Mabel,"It's not over 'til it's over, sisters! Watch this.(Runs onstage)Soos! Give me the 80s-ist, crowd pleasing-ist, rock ballad-y-ist song you got!"
Double Dipper,Soos,(Puts on Don't Start Un-Believing)
Double Dipper,Mabel,Excellent.(Singing:)Don't start UN-BELIEVING!Never don't not feel your feelings!(Everyone cheers)(Twirls her mic around)NOW I'M GONNA DO A FLIP!(lands on her face)THAT WAS FOR YOU GUYS!
Double Dipper,Narration,"Everyone cheers except Pacifica, who looks at the crowd, and Dipper whispers something in Soos' ear."
Double Dipper,Soos,"Dudes, would the owner of a silver and red dirt bike please report outside. It is being stolen right now."
Double Dipper,Robbie,"Wait, WHAT?!"
Double Dipper,Narration,Clones 3 and 4 ride Robbie's bike away from the shack and laugh.
Double Dipper,Robbie,"(Chasing them)Hey, come back here!"
Double Dipper,Dipper,"(To Wendy:)Oh, tough break. I wonder who those guys are who aren't me because I'm right here."
Double Dipper,Soos,"Now we're gonna bring it down for a minute. Ladies, dudes, now's the time."
Double Dipper,Wendy,"Oh snap, I love this song.(Sways her head in time to the music)"
Double Dipper,Mabel,"(Runs over to Dipper)Hey goofus, now's your chance to ask Wen–(Dipper covers Mabel's mouth. They move away from Wendy)Now's your chance to ask Wendy to dance! C'mon! Go!"
Double Dipper,Dipper,"Ok, ok.(Struggles to go over)I-uh,(Runs away the opposite direction)Uh, I'll be right back!"
Double Dipper,Narration,Cut to Tyrone and Dipper pacing around each other in the attic
Double Dipper,Tyrone,"Oh, I agree. You can't just go and DANCE with her."
Double Dipper,Dipper,"The dance floor is a minefield, a MINEFIELD, Tyrone!"
Double Dipper,Tyrone,What if there's a glitch in the sound system?
Double Dipper,Dipper,Stan might get in the way.
Double Dipper,Tyrone,Robbie might come back.
Double Dipper,Dipper,There's too many variables. We need help.
Double Dipper,Narration,Dipper makes 6 more clones of himself.
Double Dipper,Dipper,"Alright, Dippers! Gather round! Now's the time! You all clear on want to do?"
Double Dipper,Narration,The clones nod monotonously and leave the attic. Number 10 walks up the Soos.
Double Dipper,Number 10,"Hey, Soos, look! A glowing dot!"
Double Dipper,Soos,"Oh man, I'm so glad I turned my head. That dot does not disappoint."
Double Dipper,Narration,"While Soos is distracted, number 10 puts in a disc labeled ""Wendy Mix."" The rest of the clones do their jobs as well. Number 8, who is sitting above the party, puts a dollar on a fishing rod and dangles it in front of Stan."
Double Dipper,Stan,"Right, like I'm gonna fall for that.(pretends not to notice, then tries to grab the money)GIVE ME THAT...(Chases it away)MONEY, MONEY!"
Double Dipper,Narration,"While Stan is distracted, Number 6 rings a bell."
Double Dipper,Tyrone,"There's your cue. It's the perfect moment to ask Wendy to dance. Good luck, me!"
Double Dipper,Dipper,I don't need luck. I have a plan.(Leaves attic and sees Wendy in the hallway)AH!
Double Dipper,Wendy,"Oh hey, man. What's up?"
Double Dipper,Dipper,"W-What are you doing here? I mean, wouldn't you rather be out on the dance floor,(looks at watch)uh, in like exactly 42 seconds?"
Double Dipper,Wendy,I'm just waiting for the bathroom.
Double Dipper,Dipper,"Um, uh, okay.(Pulls out his list, to himself:)Small talk, small talk, small talk!"
Double Dipper,Wendy,"So hey, let's say everyone at this party gets stuck on a desert island. Who do you think the leader would be?"
Double Dipper,Dipper,"I, uh..."
Double Dipper,Wendy,"I think I'd go with this lunatic. (Points at a short, sweaty man dancing)"
Double Dipper,Dipper,"Ha, ha, ha.(Puts list away)I'd probably go for Stretch over there, uh, because tall people can reach coconuts?(points at a tall man doing the moonwalk)"
Double Dipper,Wendy,"Speaking of tall, wanna see something?(Pulls out a picture with her thumb over one of herbrothers)Those are my brothers, and I'm,(Lifting her thumb)boooop."
Double Dipper,Dipper,"Ha, you were a freak!(Covers mouth)"
Double Dipper,Wendy,Yep.
Double Dipper,Dipper,"You know, kids used to make fun of my birthmark before I started hiding it all the time."
Double Dipper,Wendy,Birthmark?
Double Dipper,Dipper,"Uh, no! It's nothing! I-I was-I wa–why did I say that?"
Double Dipper,Wendy,"No way, dude! Now you have to show me! Show me, show me!"
Double Dipper,Dipper,"(Lifts his bangs up to show his forehead, revealing a Big Dipper-like birthmark)"
Double Dipper,Wendy,"The Big Dipper! That's how you got your nickname! I thought your parents just hated you or something. Hey, I guess we're both freaks.(They clink cups and laugh as Pacifica exits the bathroom)Wait here?(Goes into the bathroom)"
Double Dipper,Dipper,Of course.
Double Dipper,Tyrone,(Coming in with the rest of the clones behind him)Hey! What are you doing up here? Number 10 has been distracting Soos for 15 minutes; he's gonna get tired of that dot eventually!
Double Dipper,Soos,(Off-screen:)Never!
Double Dipper,Dipper,You won't believe it guys! I bumped into Wendy accidentally and things are actually going great!
Double Dipper,Tyrone,"That's nice, but not the plan. Do we have to remind you?"
Double Dipper,Clones,(Read some steps from the list asynchronously)
Double Dipper,Dipper,"Oh man, you guys sound crazy. Look, maybe we don't need the plan anymore, you know? Maybe I could just go talk to her like a normal person."
Double Dipper,Number 9,(Gasp)
Double Dipper,Number 8,What?!
Double Dipper,Number 7,You bite your tongue!
Double Dipper,Number 5,"If you're not gonna stick to the plan, maybe you shouldn't be the Dipper to dance with Wendy."
Double Dipper,Clones,Yes/If you think about it... Five/Number Five's got a point.
Double Dipper,Dipper,"Guys, c'mon. We said we weren't gonna turn on each other."
Double Dipper,Tyrone,I think we all knew we were lying.
Double Dipper,Clones,(Grab Dipper and pull him away)
Double Dipper,Dipper,"No, no, hey, hey! AAAAAH!"
Double Dipper,Clones,(Throw Dipper in a closet)
Double Dipper,Dipper,"No, wait!"
Double Dipper,Clones,(Close the door)
Double Dipper,Dipper,"(Trying to trick Tyrone)Ahh, I can't breath in here!"
Double Dipper,Tyrone,Yes you can! Plus there's snacks and a coloring book in there for you!
Double Dipper,Dipper,"(Sigh, eats a cracker angrily)Omnomnom..."
Double Dipper,Tyrone,"Okay, now that Original Dipper or ""Dipper Classic"" is no longer fit for it, I nominate myself to dance with Wendy instead. I've been around the longest, so it should be me. Right? I mean logically. Logically, guys."
Double Dipper,Number 10,"Fair point, fair point. Counterpoint, maybe I should get to dance with Wendy because I've been around her the least."
Double Dipper,Number 5,"That makes, like, zero sense."
Double Dipper,Number 10,(Pushes number 5)YOUMAKE ZERO SENSE!

Double Dipper,Tyrone,"(Tries to give Paper Jam Dipper a cracker but realizes he has no mouth)Yikes.(To the rest of the clones:)Hey, guys, what would you do if you were trapped in a closet?"
Double Dipper,Number 5 to 10,Break out.(Looks at closet to see that it's open)
Double Dipper,Tyrone,(Facepalm)
Double Dipper,Dipper,(Runs down stairs and to balcony)WEND-!
Double Dipper,Number 5,(Covers his mouth and drags him back to the other clones)
Double Dipper,Tyrone,"C'mon, man. Give it up. You're overpowered."
Double Dipper,Dipper,"Hold on guys, think about it. We're exact equals mentally and physically. If we start fighting, it'll just go on for infinity."
Double Dipper,Narration,"As the clones agree, Dipper punches Tyrone. The clones stare at them and there is an awkward pause."
Double Dipper,Number 9,CLONE FIGHT!
Double Dipper,Narration,The clones start fighting each other.
Double Dipper,Number 5,"(Slapping Dipper)Quit hitting myself, quit hitting myself! (Is tackled by Number 8)"
Double Dipper,Narration,Numbers 5 and 8 hold Tyrone back as 10 slaps him in the stomach
Double Dipper,Tyrone,"Guys guys, c'mon it's me!"
Double Dipper,Narration,"As the clones fight, Dipper crawls through the crowd and nearly gets away. They notice Dipper and the fight stops."
Double Dipper,Number 10,Hey! Classic Dipper's getting away!
Double Dipper,Dipper,"No friends, it's me, Number 7."
Double Dipper,Narration,The clones stare at the real Number 7.
Double Dipper,Number 7,"(Shaking his head and panicking)That's not me guys, that's not me!"
Double Dipper,Narration,The fake #7 mark on Dipper's hat peels off.
Double Dipper,Number 9,Get him!
Double Dipper,Narration,The clones march toward Dipper cornering him & Dipper backs away from them.
Double Dipper,Dipper,"Stay back, stay back!"
Double Dipper,Dipper,"(Fires a party popper, which turns on the sprinkler, causing the clones to melt)"
Double Dipper,Clones,Boo! C'mon! Lame! This stinks! Boo!

Double Dipper,Mabel,"Pacifica, I just wanna say that whoever wins, it's been a super fun party."
Double Dipper,Pacifica,"Tsk. Awwww, it thinks it's gonna win. Hey, did you hear that?(Mabel cups her hand next to her ear)People clapping for the weird girls? Yeah, me neither."
Double Dipper,Narration,Cut back to Dipper and Tyrone fighting.
Double Dipper,Tyrone,Say it! Say I can dance with Wendy!
Double Dipper,Dipper,Never!
Double Dipper,Dipper and Tyrone,(Hear Wendy laughing and stop fighting)Wendy?
Double Dipper,Wendy,(Listening to something Robbie is saying and laughing.)Robbie!(Hits him)Shut up!(Laughs)
Double Dipper,Dipper and Tyrone,(Sigh)We blew it man.(Sit down)
Double Dipper,Tyrone,"I don't know, you wanna go grab a couple sodas or something?"
Double Dipper,Narration,Cut to the party room.
Double Dipper,Soos,Let the party crown voting commence!(plays bell sound)
Double Dipper,Pacifica,"(Sarcastically)Good luck,Mabel."
Double Dipper,Soos,Applaud to vote for Mabel.
Double Dipper,Narration,The crowd applauds loudly.
Double Dipper,Soos,"Let's check the applause meter.(Raises hand)Oh, oh, very good."
Double Dipper,Mabel,(Smiles)
Double Dipper,Soos,And the next contestant: Pacifica.
Double Dipper,Narration,"The crowd applauds quietly, but Pacifica glares at them angrily. More people reluctantly start to clap for her."
Double Dipper,Soos,"Uh-oh, a tie! This has like, never happened before."
Double Dipper,Pacifica,(Looks around and sees Old Man McGucket sleeping on a bench. She runs to him and gives him a dollar)
Double Dipper,Old Man McGucket,(Clapping)Ha! Haha! Hahahahaha!
Double Dipper,Soos,"Ladies and gentlemen, we-we have a winner.(Disappointed)The winner of the contest, is Pacifica Northwest.(Gives Pacifica the crown)"
Double Dipper,Pacifica,"Thank you, Jorge. Thank you everyone! Everyone comes to the after-party at my parents' boat! Woo-hoo!"
Double Dipper,Crowd,(Carrying her off)Pacifica! Pacifica! Pacifica!
Double Dipper,Mabel,(To Grenda and Candy:)Sorry I let you guys down. I understand if you wanna leave.
Double Dipper,Candy,"But then, we will miss the sleepover."
Double Dipper,Mabel,The what?
Double Dipper,Grenda,"We want to call our moms and see if we can sleep over here with you. You're like, a total rock star!"
Double Dipper,Candy,(Pulls a magazine out of her bag)I have magazine boys.
Double Dipper,Mabel,Really? You GUUYS!
Double Dipper,Candy,"Maybe we don't have as many friends as Pacifica, but we have each other, and that is pretty good I think."
Double Dipper,Mabel,(to Soos:)Soos! Play another song! This thing's going all night!
Double Dipper,Soos,"Way ahead of you, hambone.(Plays a song)"
Double Dipper,Mabel,(Dancing)This is it! This is it!
Double Dipper,Candy,(Dancing)Dance! Dance! Dance!
Double Dipper,Narration,"Cut to the roof, Dipper passes Tyrone a can ofsoda."
Double Dipper,Tyrone,"Some night, huh?"
Double Dipper,Narration,A shooting star flies across the starry night. Dipper and Tyrone open the cans.
Double Dipper,Dipper,"You think we even have a chance with Wendy? I mean she's 15, we're 12."
Double Dipper,Tyrone,"I don't know man, I hope so, but we're making zero progress the way we're doin' it. The only good conversation you had with her is when you didn't do anything in that list-stuff."
Double Dipper,Dipper,"I know. Mabel was right, I do get in my own way."
Double Dipper,Dipper and Tyrone,Literally!
Double Dipper,Tyrone,Wow!(makes an explosion sound).
Double Dipper,Dipper and Tyrone,(Touch cans and drink the soda)
Double Dipper,Tyrone,"(Stomach melts)Oh boy, don't look now."
Double Dipper,Dipper,Tyrone!
Double Dipper,Tyrone,"It's okay dude, I had a good run. Remember what we talked about."
Double Dipper,Dipper,"Uh-uh, of course."
Double Dipper,Tyrone,"Hey, and quit being such a wimp around Wendy okay? For my sake...(Melts completely)BLBLBLBLBLBL!"
Double Dipper,Dipper,Tyrone! You were the only one who understood.(Pours soda on where Tyrone melted and drinks what's left. He goes to the front door and looks in the window.)
Double Dipper,Stan,(Counting money)Hahaha!
Double Dipper,Narration,"Soos is playing music and the girls are dancing. Wendy is by the side nodding her head to the beat. Dipper prepares to go in, then stops and rips up the list and goes inside the shack."
Double Dipper,Mabel,Dipper! Where have you been? Meet my girlfriends!
Double Dipper,Narration,End credits.
Double Dipper,Soos,"(Presses the keyboard buttons one by one. From left-to-right, it plays the sound effects of a doorbell, a small explosion, a clown horn, a man saying ""Yeah!"", a gong, a cat, a tube getting plugged, a monkey, a man saying ""Agh!"", a gulp, a baby cry, a hammer banging an anvil, a cuckoo clock, a dog, crickets, and a toilet. The last one is the thunder andlightning)Found it."
Irrational Treasure,Narration,The episode begins with the twins eatingCorncornosinsideStan's car.Stanis honking whileMabelattaches nachos from her chip bag to her ears.
Irrational Treasure,Mabel Pines,Ha-ha! Nacho earrings. I'm hilarious!
Irrational Treasure,Stan Pines,"That's debatable. Aw, come on, what's with all this traffic? And why is it all...covered wagons?(Realizes in shock and horror)Oh no! No! No!(Pushes gas pedal)Not today!Not today!"
Irrational Treasure,Narration,"A few women gasp in the presence of him nearly running them over. He backs up, and begins to drive the car backwards."
Irrational Treasure,Dipper Pines,"Grunkle Stan, what's going on?"
Irrational Treasure,Stan,We gotta get outta here... Before it's too late!(Sees that his car his trapped between a group of covered wagons)They've circled the wagons! We're trapped!NOOOOOOOOO!!
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,(Looks outside her window and sees a cow)I've got a good feeling about today.
Irrational Treasure,Narration,Cut to thetheme song.
Irrational Treasure,Narration,The twins and Stan get out of the car and walk around an old fashioned-lookingMain Street.
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,"Man, look at the town.(Holds a postcard up for a second. When he lowers it, the town is a sepia shade, but it is just due to a pane of dirty glass)"
Irrational Treasure,Worker,"(Walking by, holding one end of the pane of dirty glass)Dirty glass. We got dirty glass! Dirty glass."
Irrational Treasure,Stan,"Ah, boy. It'sPioneer Day. Every year these yahoos dress up like idiots to celebrate the dayGravity Fallswas founded."
Irrational Treasure,Toby Determined,(Approaches Stan as a paperboy)Welcome to 1863!
Irrational Treasure,Stan,"(Pulls up his left sleeve to threaten Toby)I willbreakyou, little man!"
Irrational Treasure,Toby,Ahh!(Runs away and crashes into a barrel)
Irrational Treasure,Narration,"Cuts to a view of people doing various activities, panning right. People doing candle dipping."
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,Wow! Look! Candle dipping!
Irrational Treasure,Narration,"People doing gold panning.Old Man McGucket, who is also gold panning, can be heard in the background, saying ""Gold!"""
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,"Whoa, gold panning!"
Irrational Treasure,Priest,(To amanandwoodpecker:)I now pronounce you man and wife.
Irrational Treasure,Woodpecker,(Pecks her husband's hand)
Irrational Treasure,Woodpecker guy,I do!
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,(Confused)What chu talking 'bout?
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,Oh yeah. I remember this.(Takes outJournal 3)In Gravity Falls it used to belegal to marry woodpeckers.
Irrational Treasure,Woodpecker guy,"Oh, it's still legal.(Puts a hand on his shoulder, where the woodpecker is perched)Verylegal.(Walks away as the announcer speaks up)"
Irrational Treasure,Announcer,Come one and all for the opening ceremonies!
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,"Grunkle Stan, you coming?"
Irrational Treasure,Stan,"No, thank you! Just remember if you come back to theShacktalking like these people, you're dead to me!"
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,(Starts acting with a Southern twang in his voice)Thar's a carpetbagger in the turnip cellar!
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,"Well, hornswabber my haversack!"
Irrational Treasure,Dipper and Mabel,"(Spit on ground and run off, laughing)"
Irrational Treasure,Stan,"(Raises his fist, angrily)DEAD TO ME!!!"
Irrational Treasure,Narration,A crowd assembles around a large stage.
Irrational Treasure,Sheriff Blubs,"Here-ye, here-ye! Ye olde commencement ceremony is about to commence."
Irrational Treasure,Deputy Durland,(Ringing bell)Woo! I got a bell!
Irrational Treasure,Narration,"Cut to the audience, where a robber steals anold woman'spurse."
Irrational Treasure,Old woman,"Oh, no! Police, my purse!"

Irrational Treasure,Blubs,(Chuckles)He sure loves his bell.
Irrational Treasure,Pacifica Northwest,"(Comes on stage and taps a microphone)Howdy, everyone! You all know me, Pacifica Northwest, great-great granddaughter of town-founder,Nathaniel Northwest. I'm also very rich."
Irrational Treasure,Narration,The crowd applauds.
Irrational Treasure,Pacifica,"Now if you've got the pioneer spirit, we ask you to come on up and introduce yourself."
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,(Gasps)Audience participation!
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,"I don't know, Mabel. Isn't that girl kinda like your arch-enemy?"
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,That's water under the bridge.(Laughs and runs onstage)
Irrational Treasure,Pacifica,Our first newcomer is...(Sees Mabel; angrily:)Mabel...
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,Yeah! Let's get this Pioneer Day started! Right guys? USA! USA!
Irrational Treasure,Crowd,USA! USA!
Irrational Treasure,America guy,"(While crying tears of joy:)USA, USA!"
Irrational Treasure,Pacifica,"I'm sorry to break it to you, but Pioneer Day is for serious people, and you look and act ridiculous.(Looking at Mabel's sweater)I mean, a puppy playing basketball? Are you always this silly?"
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,"(Grabs onto her sweater, looking embarrassed)Hey, I can be serious!(Glares)"
Irrational Treasure,Pacifica,"You do have nachos hanging from your ears, hon."
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,(Touches her nacho earrings and blushes in embarrassment)
Irrational Treasure,Pacifica,"Haha, wow, I'm embarrassed for you.(To the audience:)Give her a hand everybody!"
Irrational Treasure,Narration,Crowd applauds and Dipper looks worried.
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,(Sadly walks off of the stage)
Irrational Treasure,Pacifica,Now who wants to hear more aboutme?
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,(To the people standing near him as he makes his way toward Mabel)Excuse me.
Irrational Treasure,Pacifica,(As the Northwest Family lines up for a photo)Everyone say Northwest!
Irrational Treasure,Northwest Family,Northwest!
Irrational Treasure,Narration,"Camera clicks, taking picture."
Irrational Treasure,Pacifica,(Laughs and tilts head)We're perfect.
Irrational Treasure,Narration,Cut to Mabel and Dipper.
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,"(To Mabel:)Hey, you okay?"
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,I need some old-timey butterscotch.
Irrational Treasure,Narration,"Cut to Stan in his car, which is stuck in the mud.Stevewalks up to him."
Irrational Treasure,Stan,"Hey there, uh, donkey boy! Give me a hand with my car, huh?"
Irrational Treasure,Steve,"Here in 1863, I have never heard-tell of a ""car."" Pray-tell,(Uses his crowbar to poke Stan's car)what is this magic wheel box?"
Irrational Treasure,Stan,"Ah, c'mon, Steve, you're a mechanic for Pete's sake! Cut me some slack."
Irrational Treasure,Steve,"""Slack""... I am unfamiliar with thisbold, new expression."
Irrational Treasure,Stan,I can't take this anymore!(Grabs Steve by the collar)I'm getting dumber every second I'm here!
Irrational Treasure,Blubs,(Running up alongside Durland)Are we gonna have to intervene here?
Irrational Treasure,Stan,"Oh, look. The ""Constable."" What are you gonna do? Throw me in ""ye stocks?""(Laughs.)"
Irrational Treasure,Narration,Cut to Stan in stocks.
Irrational Treasure,Stan,"Aw, c'mon!(Gideon, wearing old fashioned, nobleman attire, walks by, humming)Hey, nice outfit, Gideon. You actually looklessgirly than usual."
Irrational Treasure,Gideon Gleeful,"Why, Stanford. I'm just a humble tomato farmer, selling his wares. Whoops, I dropped one.(Throws a tomato at Stan's left eye)Whoops, I dropped another one.(Throws a tomato at Stan's right eye)"
Irrational Treasure,Stan,"Ugh!(Tomatoes still covering his eyes, looks up at sky and screams angrily:)PIONEER DAY!!!"
Irrational Treasure,Narration,"Scene transitions to the twins sitting near a large statue of Nathaniel Northwest. Mabel eats a candy piece, mildly depressed."
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,"Dipper, can I ask you something? Do you think I'm silly?"
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,"Uh, nnnoooo?"
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,"I knew it! The nacho earrings, the sweater. I thought I was being charming, but I guess people see me as a big joke.(Throws off her nacho earrings, takes off her sweater, and ties her sweater around her waist)"
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,"C'mon, Mabel, you love that sweater!"
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,I did before Pacifica ruined it for me. She ruins everything!
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,"(Stands up, turns around, and glares at the statue)Pacifica! Why does she think that being related to the town founder means she gets to treat everyone like garbage? Someone needs to take her down a peg.(Gasps)Wait a minute! I feel like I read something about Pacifica's great-great grandfather before.(OpensJournal 3)Of course! Oh, this is perfect.(In a deep voice:)""In my investigations...""(Normal voice:)Should- should I do the voice?"
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,(Cringes)Nuh-uh.
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,"I'll just read... normal.(Reading from journal:)""In my investigations I recently made a discovery. Nathaniel Northwest may not be the founder of Gravity Falls! I believe this secret is emburied somewhere on the enclosed document. If only I could crack the code.""(Opens the document, revealing a complex series of letters, symbols and words)Oh, man! If this cover-up is true, it means Pacifica's whole family is a fraud. This could be a major conspiracy!"
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,Really?
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,I got to investigate this!
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,"Wait! I'm coming with you. Conspiracies are serious, right?"
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,"Oh yeah, definitely."
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,"Well, if I help you crack this code, then nobody could ever call me silly again!"
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,Yeah! Mystery twins?
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,I thought you hated that.
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,I'm starting to accept it.
Irrational Treasure,Dipper and Mabel,(Fist bump and run off)
Irrational Treasure,Narration,"As Mabel takes her bag of candies to catch up with Dipper, Sheriff Blubs is seen eavesdropping behind the statue. He immediately speaks to adispatchervia walkie-talkie."
Irrational Treasure,Blubs,This is Sheriff Blubs. We've got a code sepia!
Irrational Treasure,Dispatcher,(Spits out coffee)What?! And what are you doing about it?
Irrational Treasure,Blubs,I'm following them right now.
Irrational Treasure,Dispatcher,Find them and stop them. There's no room for error.
Irrational Treasure,Blubs,"I understand. Blubs out.(To Durland:)Deputy Durland, maintaining this cover-up is the mission we've been training for our entire careers. Are you ready?"
Irrational Treasure,Durland,(Ringing bell)Whoo!
Irrational Treasure,Blubs,"Hehe, if being delightful was a crime, you'd be breaking the law."
Irrational Treasure,Durland,"Let's go get 'em!(Both start chasing after the twins, whooping)"
Irrational Treasure,Narration,Cuts to inside theGravity Falls Library.
Irrational Treasure,McGucket,"Back in the olden days, pioneers drew subsistence from telling stories 'round the fire. So let's eat some books, children! Go ahead, eat the books!(Chews a book like a dog)"
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,"Alright, Mabel, if we can prove that Nathaniel Northwest wasn't the real founder of Gravity Falls, it'll finally put Pacifica in her place."
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,And solving a mystery will prove that I'm not silly. I'm serious.(Laps up candy from the table into her mouth with her tongue)Seeeeriousss...
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,"(Places some slides into a projector)We just need to crack this code. Let me see... it's not Egyptian, it's not numerology, it's not, wait-of course! The triangle is the alchemist symbol for flame. Lighting the parchment on fire will reveal the secret message!"
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,It's so obvious!(Dipper picks up a lit candlestick)
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,"Alright, let's just light this sucker up and--- Mabel!"
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,"(Now wearing a hat she made out of the document)Mwop! I just made a hat. Ugh, I just did something silly again.(Blows a raspberry)"
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,"Wait, Mabel. You folded it into a map! And I was gonnaburnit..."
Irrational Treasure,Blubs,(To alibrarian:)We're on the lookout for two kids who might be reading.
Irrational Treasure,Durland,We're hunting 'em down for secret reasons!(Rings bell)WHOO!
Irrational Treasure,Dipper and Mabel,(Hide under the table.)
Irrational Treasure,Durland,(Knocks row of books off a shelf)DERP!
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,(To Mabel:)Maybe we should take this elsewhere...
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,This map should lead us to...(Cut to the twins standing in front of amuseum.)...The Gravity Falls Museum of History.
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,"You realize what this means, Mabel.(Looks up and squints.)We're gonna have to break in."
Irrational Treasure,Narration,Dramatic music plays. Cut to Dipper and Mabel inside the museum at the entrance.
Irrational Treasure,Sue,"...And those are your free Pioneer Day passes, and your balloons, blue and pink.(Hands them balloons)"
Irrational Treasure,Narration,Dramatic music plays.
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,(Still looking up and squinting)We're in.
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,"(Walking through museum)What are we gonna do next, steal Thomas Jefferson's rib cage?"
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,"Ewww, no. According to the map, the next clue about the real town founder should be right... here!"
Irrational Treasure,Narration,A triangular exhibition piece is mounted on the wall.
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,"We've gotta figure this one out quick, I have a feeling those cops weren't at the library to check out books..."
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,I don't think the one with the bell can read...
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,So what is it anyway?
Irrational Treasure,Narration,The twins analyze the exhibit.
Irrational Treasure,Both,Hmmmm...
Irrational Treasure,Narration,Mabel gets bored and walks over to a bench to sit down.
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,"(Walks over to a bench and sits down; turning upside-down on the bench)Hey painting, be less stupid!(Gasps)It worked!"
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,"Huh?(Runs over and lays upside-down on the bench. He sees an angel statue pointing left)Wait! It's not abstract, it's upside-down!"
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,I think I've seen that statue in thecemetery.
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,Let's go! Quick!
Irrational Treasure,Both,"(Stand up and get dizzy, holding their heads)Ow."
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,Head rush.
Irrational Treasure,Sue,"(To Deputy Durland:)I'm sorry, but we're all out of pink balloons."
Irrational Treasure,Durland,(Disappointed:)Why did we even come?
Irrational Treasure,Dispatcher,(Over walkie-talkie:)Officer Blubs.
Irrational Treasure,Blubs,(Runs into the museum so that they're out of earshot; using walkie-talkie:)Blubs here.
Irrational Treasure,Dispatcher,Have the targets been apprehended?
Irrational Treasure,Blubs,"Negative, but we're close. I promise, those kids'll never get past us."
Irrational Treasure,Dipper and Mabel,(Run past them)
Irrational Treasure,Blubs,Hey! Wait!
Irrational Treasure,Narration,"Blubs and Durland chase the kids out of the museum, but get stuck in the door."
Irrational Treasure,Blubs,Dang it!
Irrational Treasure,Narration,Cut to the Woodpecker and husband's house.
Irrational Treasure,Woodpecker guy,"For the last time, we arenotgoing south for the winter! Our home is here!"
Irrational Treasure,Woodpecker,(Pecks the table)
Irrational Treasure,Woodpecker guy,Youalwayssay that!(Storms out of the house)
Irrational Treasure,Stan,"(Struggling to get out of the stocks, trying to unlock the lock with a hairpin in his mouth)C'mon! C'mon, ugh!(Drops pin)"
Irrational Treasure,Pacifica,"(Picks up the pin)Well, if it isn't Mabel's uncle, Mr. Pines. Looking for this?(Holds up the pin)"
Irrational Treasure,Stan,"Yeah, yeah. What d' ya want, money?"
Irrational Treasure,Pacifica,I want you to say that the Northwest family is the best family in Gravity Falls.
Irrational Treasure,Stan,"Oh sure, you want that in writing?"
Irrational Treasure,Pacifica,(Gives Stan a pen and let him writes something on a note with his mouth)
Irrational Treasure,Stan,"There you go.(The note says ""YOU STINK!"")Ha! I did that with my mouth!"
Irrational Treasure,Pacifica,"(Whistles, catching the attention of people with tomatoes, and points to Stan)"
Irrational Treasure,Stan,"Aw, come on!"
Irrational Treasure,Narration,Cuts to Dipper and Mabel in the cemetery. Dipper is looking at the angel statue that is pointing off in the distance.
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,Ah... The statue must be pointing to the next clue.(Looks in direction statue is pointing but then turns back when Mabel speaks up)
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,"(The finger of the statue sticking in her nose)Oh, gross! She's picking my nose! Ha ha!(The tip of the statue's finger bends upward, opening a secret door in the grave)Ach."
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,"Mabel, look!"
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,"Ha! Who's silly now, Pacifica? Bam!(Tries to jump down from statue but her nose is still there so the finger tugs on her nose)Ahh! Ow. Ow. Ow.(Getting down from the statue)Okay."
Irrational Treasure,Narration,Dipper and Mabel walk down the secret steps leading to a dark underground tunnel.
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,"Now we're getting into real conspiracy mode. I feelsoserious. Mmm.(Eats candy, leaves wrapper behind)"
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,"Okay, look out for booby traps."
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,Ha! Booby traps.(Steps on a tile that triggers a bunch of darts to fly out of the wall towards her and Dipper)
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,Tranquilizer darts!(Grabs Mabel's hand and maneuvers through the darts)
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,Aah!
Irrational Treasure,Narration,"They dodge the darts and slide down a path that leads them to a small set-up filled with confidential, historical information."
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,"It's a treasure trove of historic-y, secret-y things.(Picks up a top-secret document. The first page is about the secret of Abraham Lincoln's hat, and shows a picture ofLincolnin his top hat in one picture, and him without his top hat, with a hand sticking out of the top of his head, in the other. Mabel looks at the next page, where there is a picture ofBenjamin Franklinwearing earrings, and the sub-caption says that he was secretly a woman)Oh, man! Ben Franklin secretlywasa woman!"
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,"(Finding and picking up adocumenttitled ""Northwest Cover-up"")Hey, jackpot! Now we'll find out who the real town founder was.(Reading from document:)""Let it be here recorded that Nathaniel Northwest, fabled founder of Gravity Falls, was, in fact, a fraud...as well as a waste-shoveling villageidiot""?(Laughs)Oh, bad news for Pacifica. Wait'll the papers hear about this!"
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,"Once people see that I uncovered a historical conspiracy, they can never call me silly!"
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,"(Reading from document:)""The true founder of Gravity Falls was Sir Lord,Quentin Trembley, III, Esquire."""
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,Who's Quentin Trembley?(Blubs and Durland suddenly arrive with a flashlight)
Irrational Treasure,Blubs,That'snone of your business!(Dipper and Mabel gasp in surprise)
Irrational Treasure,Durland,Whoo! We gotcha! Whoo!(Weakly:)Whoo! Hmm... whoo-hoo...(Passes out. Several tranquilizer darts are sticking out of his back and head)
Irrational Treasure,Blubs,He got hit with quite a few of those darts.
Irrational Treasure,Narration,Commercial break.
Irrational Treasure,Blubs,"I hate to do this, but Quentin Trembley's a matter of national security."
Irrational Treasure,Durland,Yeah! Ye--ah...(Puts hands on knees)woo. I think I might be colorblind now.
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,"What do you mean, ""national security?"""
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,"And who is Quentin Trembley, anyway?"
Irrational Treasure,Blubs,"See for yourself.(Removes hat and takes out a reel of film. He puts it into a projector, and the projection screen shows a countdown in black and white)"
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,"Aww, it's black and white?!"
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,Shh! Mabel.
Irrational Treasure,Narration,"Reel starts, revealing a government official in an office."
Irrational Treasure,Govt. official,"If you're watching this, then you are one of eight people in these United States with clearance to view this information. In fact, I myself will be shot as soon as the filming is complete.(Looks offscreen)--What? No? Ho! Well, that's a relief!(Looks back at the camera)Of all of America's secrets, the most embarrassing was that of Quentin Trembley: The eighth-and-a-half president of the United States."
Irrational Treasure,Dipper and Mabel,President?
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,Eighth-and-a-half?
Irrational Treasure,Govt. official,"After winning the 1837 election in a landslide,(On the video, a picture of Quentin Trembley standing next to the other presidential candidates is shown. A landslide kills the other candidates)Quentin Trembley quickly gained a reputation as America's silliest president. He waged war on pancakes, appointed six babies to the Supreme Court, and issued the de-pants-ipation proclamation. His state of the union speech was even worse."
Irrational Treasure,Trembley(reenacted recording),"The only thing we have to fear is gigantic, man-eating spiders!"
Irrational Treasure,Govt. official,"He was kicked out of office and escaped to an uncharted valley he namedGravity Falls, after plummeting into it at high speed.(A picture of Trembly riding a horse backwards while plummeting down a cliff is shown)Trembley's shameful term was erased from history and officially replaced byWilliam Henry Harrisonas President and local nobody Nathaniel Northwest as founder of Gravity Falls. The whereabouts of president Trembley's body are unknown.(The film finishes rolling)"
Irrational Treasure,Blubs,Until now.
Irrational Treasure,Narration,"Cut to Quentin Trembley, who is encased in an amber-colored rectangle."
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,"Whoa! Is that, like, amber or something?"
Irrational Treasure,Blubs,"The fool thought he could live forever by encasing himself in a block of solid peanut brittle. Smooth move, Mr. President! Finding Trembley's body was our special mission. And now, thanks to you, it's complete."
Irrational Treasure,Durland,Who knew all we had to do was follow a little girl's(Holds up one of Mabel's candy wrappers)trail of candy wrappers?
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,"Ugh,(Face-palms)silly!"
Irrational Treasure,Blubs,"Now that you know the truth, well, we can't let you go around talkin' about it."
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,Does that mean--?
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,Are you going to kill us?!
Irrational Treasure,Durland,OH NO!
Irrational Treasure,Blubs,"No, no.(To Durland:)Calm down now, buddy, calm down.(To the twins:)We're just gonna escort you and all this stuff back to Washington. You ain't comin' back, by the way."
Irrational Treasure,Narration,Cut to the inside of a train
Irrational Treasure,Durland,(Unfolds fold-out bed)Woo-hoo! We got fold-out beds!
Irrational Treasure,Blubs,(Opens suitcase and pulls out book)Good thing I brought my book of spooky ghost stories!
Irrational Treasure,Durland,(Takes out colored rope)I brought rope for friendship bracelets!
Irrational Treasure,Narration,Cut to Dipper and Mabel who are trapped in a crate with Quentin Trembley's body.
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,Anyone there?! Help help help!
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,Hey! Let us out!
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,"Oh. I can't believe I left a trail of candy wrappers. This is all my fault. Pacifica had me pegged all along. I'm just a silly failure, like that embarrassing president what's-his-name.(Eats piece of peanut brittle, breaking the block and freeing Trembley)"
Irrational Treasure,Dipper and Mabel,Aahh!
Irrational Treasure,Trembley,"It is I, Quentin Trembley.(Rips off pants)"
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,You're alive! But how?
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,"Peanut brittle reallydoeshave life-sustaining properties! You're not silly, you're brilliant!"
Irrational Treasure,Trembley,"And so are you, dear girl, for following my clues and freeing me from my delicious tomb!"
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,"He's right! Making maps into hats, hanging upside-down; Your silliness solved the code that serious cops couldn't crack in a hundred years!"
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,"Oh, stop it."
Irrational Treasure,Trembley,By Jefferson! We seem to be trapped in some sort of crate-shaped box.
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,"It's a crate, Mr. President."
Irrational Treasure,Trembley,"(Pulls out key)Good thing I have the President's Key, which can open any lock in America!(Repeatedly slams it at the side of the crate)"
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,I... don't think that's gonna work.
Irrational Treasure,Trembley,"Wood! My age-old enemy. In order to get out of here, this is going to take the silliest plan ever conceived."
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,I think I know who can help you.(Smiles at Mabel)
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,Hmm. How 'bout... that hole?(Points to tiny hole near the corner of the crate)
Irrational Treasure,Trembley,We will leapthroughit!
Irrational Treasure,Trembley and Mabel,(Jump at the hole)
Irrational Treasure,Trembley,"(To Mabel, who's poking her finger through hole and moving it around:)Almost. Almost there Good! Keep pushing."
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,I'm not sure this is working.
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,Trust... the silliness!
Irrational Treasure,Trembley,Fiddlesticks! Keep going!
Irrational Treasure,Narration,"A woodpecker flies in and pecks at the crate, making a tapping noise."
Irrational Treasure,Trembley,Is that my third wife? Sandy?
Irrational Treasure,Narration,The box falls apart.
Irrational Treasure,Trembley,"Well, we didn't fit through the hole. Let's rebuild the box and try again!"
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,We gotta get out of here!
Irrational Treasure,Trembley,Also good!
Irrational Treasure,Narration,"Dipper opens a door in the train and Durland, who is getting ice, sees the three of them and drops the bucket of ice."
Irrational Treasure,Durland,Blubs!
Irrational Treasure,Narration,"Dipper, Mabel, and Trembley run away. They climb up a ladder to get to the emergency escape. Trembley pulls out his key and starts pressing it against the door even though there's no lock."
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,"(Taking the key from Trembley)Give me that! (Turns the handle and they all run out onto the roof of the train, followed by Blubs and Durland)"
Irrational Treasure,Blubs,There(Huffs)is(Huffs)no(Huffs)escape! I gotta take a knee.
Irrational Treasure,Durland,Are you okay? Can I get you anything?
Irrational Treasure,Blubs,"Edwin Durland, you are a diamond in the rough."
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,"Sheriff Blubs, do you really want to lock us all up in a government facility somewhere?"
Irrational Treasure,Blubs,I've got no choice! Our orders come from the very top!
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,"Wait! Quentin, did you ever sign an official resignation?"
Irrational Treasure,Trembley,"No, sir. I ate a salamander and jumped out the window."
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,"Then... technically you're still legally the President of the United States, right?(To Blubs and Durland:)You've gotta answer tothisguy now!"
Irrational Treasure,Blubs and Durland,Huh?
Irrational Treasure,Trembley,"As president of these several United States, I hereby order you to pretend none of this ever happened. And- and go on a delightful vacation.(As the train goes by he hits his head on a metal rail)Ow! Mmm yeeees!"
Irrational Treasure,Blubs,"Vacation?(To Durland:)What place have you always wanted to visit? One, two--"
Irrational Treasure,Blubs and Durland,"Silly Water Fun Slides in Grand Lakes, Michigan!"
Irrational Treasure,Narration,"Cut to Dipper, Mabel, and Trembley outside of the train. Durland and Blubs are in the train wearing Hawaiian shirts and wave to the three as the train departs."
Irrational Treasure,Blubs and Durland,Bye-bye! Bye!
Irrational Treasure,Trembley,"(Once the train is gone, he gets to a knee and looks at Mabel)You've done a great service to your country, Mabel. As thanks, I'd like to make you an official U.S. congressman.(Unfolds a black top-hat and hands it to Mabel)"
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,(Puts on hat)I'm legalizing everything!
Irrational Treasure,Trembley,"(To Dipper:)And Roderick,"
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,Uh- actually- uh-
Irrational Treasure,Trembley,You dear boy are on your way to unlocking the mysteries of this great land. So I'd like you to have myPresident's Key!
Irrational Treasure,Narration,"Cut to Trembley and the twins later on, back in Gravity Falls. Trembley is telling a story."
Irrational Treasure,Trembley,"And then he chased me around and spanked me with a paddle for, like, three hours. Bottom line,George Washingtonwas ajerk."
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,A-greed!
Irrational Treasure,Narration,Cut to Pacifica andher friendswatching girls run around a small maypole.
Irrational Treasure,Smabble,"(Trips, but saves herself so that she doesn't fall onto the ground)Oh!"
Irrational Treasure,Pacifica,(To her friends:)Kick her off the team.
Irrational Treasure,Narration,Pacifica's friends walk away to do as she said. Mabel approaches Pacifica.
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,"Hey, Pacifica! I uncovered a government conspiracy about the eighth-and-a-half president of the United States! Who's silly now?"
Irrational Treasure,Pacifica,What? Who is that idiot?
Irrational Treasure,Narration,"Cut to Trembley, who has his fists up and is chasing after a bald eagle."
Irrational Treasure,Trembley,"Put up your dukes, you bald fiend!"
Irrational Treasure,Narration,Cut back to Mabel and Pacifica.
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,"The eighth-and-a-half president of America. I know what you're thinking. How is he still alive? Well, turns out you can hibernate in peanut brittle and it--"
Irrational Treasure,Pacifica,"(Bursts out into laughter)Wow! You really are a sad, dumb little girl. Nice top hat, by the way."
Irrational Treasure,Narration,PrestonandPriscilla Northwestlaugh mockingly.
Irrational Treasure,Preston Northwest,"(Laughs)Good one, daughter."
Irrational Treasure,Pacifica,Ooh! I see your car is stuck in the mud.(Gets into sedan)Enjoy walking home!
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,(To Mabel:)Aren't you gonna tell her about herate-gray ampa-gray?
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,"You know what, Dipper? I've got nothing to prove. I've learned that being silly is awesome!"
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,"Well, I haven't learned anything!(Whistles)Hey, Pacifica!"
Irrational Treasure,Narration,Dipper runs to the Northwests' sedan. The car stops and Dipper hands Pacifica the documents on the Northwest cover-up through the window.
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,"Nathaniel Northwest didn't found Gravity Falls, and your whole family is a sham. Deal with it!"
Irrational Treasure,Narration,"Car drives away, and Pacifica looks out the back window, shocked."
Irrational Treasure,Pacifica,What?! Moooom!!!
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,"(Now back at Mabel's side)Man, revenge is underrated. That feltawesome!"
Irrational Treasure,Trembley,"Children, I am needed elsewhere. Just know that I'll always be right here...(Pulls outbill)On the negative twelve dollar bill.(Hands Dipper bill)"
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,(Examines bill)Whoa. This is worthless.
Irrational Treasure,Trembley,"It'slessthan worthless, my boy. Trembley away!"
Irrational Treasure,Narration,Trembley jumps backwards onto a horse and rides away.
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,Where do you think he's going?
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,I'm gonna say... off a cliff.
Irrational Treasure,Narration,"Cut to Stan, who is telling to the twins the story of his imprisonment."
Irrational Treasure,Stan,"And thenSooscame by and talked to me for like, anhour."
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,You've been through so much.
Irrational Treasure,Dipper,(Uses President's key to unlock the lock on the stocks and freeing Stan)It works!
Irrational Treasure,Stan,(To Mabel:)So what's with the top hat?
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,I am a congressman.
Irrational Treasure,Stan,Pardon me?
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,You are officially pardoned.
Irrational Treasure,Narration,"Dipper and Mabel laugh, to Stan's befuddlement."
Irrational Treasure,Stan,"Oy! You a never gonna make sense, are you, kid?"
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,"No, I'm not, Grunkle Stan. No, I'm not. Mabel, away!(Jumps backward)"
Irrational Treasure,Narration,Crashing sound.
Irrational Treasure,Mabel,I'm okay!
Irrational Treasure,Narration,Cut to end tag. Trembley is in a courtroom talking to babies with mustaches wearing top hats.
Irrational Treasure,Trembley,"Esteemed gentlemen of the United States Supreme Court, I implore you to rethink your decision!"
Irrational Treasure,Narration,The babies just sit there making cooing noises.
Irrational Treasure,Trembley,Very well. But who would you have replace me?
Irrational Treasure,Baby,Mama.
Irrational Treasure,Trembley,That old crone?!
Irrational Treasure,Baby,Ba ba ba...
Irrational Treasure,Trembley,"Chief Justice Num-Num, y-you're spitting up on yourself! Now ohh! Oh, come on! This is a courtroom! I... this... this is a dark day for America."

The Time Traveler's Pig,Stan,"When there's no cops around, anything's legal!Soos, how's that dunk tank coming along?"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Soos Ramirez,"(Using a blowtorch on the handle of a dunk tank)Almost ready to go, Mr. Pines."
The Time Traveler's Pig,Stan,"(Knocks on the target and the seat barely moves)Ha, you got it rigged from here to Timbuktu! There's nothing on Earth that could knock me down!"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Soos,"Yeah, except for like afuturistic laser arm cannon."
The Time Traveler's Pig,Stan,"Ah. Hey, you haven't seen my red screwdriver, have ya? Darn thing went missing. (Digs around in toolbox)"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Soos,Maybe some magical creature or paranormal thing-um took it.
The Time Traveler's Pig,Stan,"Oi! You've been spending too much time with those kids. (Keeps digging in toolbox and mumbling) Alright, let's see where'd I put that thing."
The Time Traveler's Pig,Blendin Blandin,"(Behind some portable toilets)The mission is proceeding as planned. Over. (Uses Stan's red screwdriver to fix hiscamouflage suit, then walks away)"

The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,"Okay, you're right, it is! Isn't this amazing? I just dove in! I said, ""Hey! You wanna hang out at the fair?"" And you know what she said?"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Narration,Flashback to Dipper and Wendy in the gift shop
The Time Traveler's Pig,Wendy,"Yeah, I guess so."
The Time Traveler's Pig,Narration,Cut back to the present
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,"""Yeah, I guess so!"" It totally worked! All your advice about just going for it, it's finally paying off!"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Mabel,"When are you gonna learn, Dipper? I'm always right about everything! Hey, do you smell a gallon of body spray?"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Robbie Valentino,"(Walks up)Hey, have either of you dorks seen Wendy around?"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,Who wants to know?
The Time Traveler's Pig,Robbie,(Takes some of Mabel's cotton candy)

The Time Traveler's Pig,Robbie,"Yeah, I got some new super tight jeans.(thrusts)Thought she might want to check 'em out."
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,"Yeah! You know, I think I saw her in the Bottomless Pit. You should really go jump in there."
The Time Traveler's Pig,Robbie,"Maybe I will, smart guy.(Bumps Dipper on his way away)"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Mabel,He is such a jerk.
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,"Yeah, but he's a jerk with tight pants and a guitar. I need to keep him away from Wendy at all costs."
The Time Traveler's Pig,Mabel,"I'll be there with you, brother. Whatever happens, I'll be right here, supporting you every step of the–OH MY GOSH, A PIG!! (Runs frantically and bumps several people on the way to the pigpen)"

The Time Traveler's Pig,Mabel,(Hugs 15-Poundy)Everything is different now.
The Time Traveler's Pig,Wendy,"Whoa, check it out! I don't know if it's a duck or a panda, but I want one!"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,"(Walks up to ball toss game)My uncle taught me the secret to these games. You aim for the carnie's head, and take the prize when he's unconscious."

The Time Traveler's Pig,Wendy,AH! MY EYE!
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,"Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! Wendy, are you okay?!"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Wendy,Does it look swollen?(She has a black eye)

The Time Traveler's Pig,Blendin,(Grabs time machine and runs off)
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,(Finishes scraping ice into bag and starts toward Wendy; stops when he hears Robbie)
The Time Traveler's Pig,Robbie,Just ease your eyeball into that freezy cone.
The Time Traveler's Pig,Wendy,"(With her eye in a snow cone)Robbie, thanks. That's really sweet. The gesture, and the flavored syrup."
The Time Traveler's Pig,Robbie,"Yeah, I was just here in the right place at the right time. Y'know, I've been meaning to ask you... we've been spending a lot of time together and I was wondering if, maybe, you wanted to go out with me?"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,(Whimpers)
The Time Traveler's Pig,Wendy,"Yeah, I guess so."
The Time Traveler's Pig,Robbie,Sweet!
The Time Traveler's Pig,Narration,Dipper is horrified. A balloon shaped like a heart is popped by a dart behind him. All the ice falls out of the bag.

The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,"(Points at Robbie and Wendy getting on a ride called ""Tunnel of Love and Corn-dogs"")"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Mabel,Oh...
The Time Traveler's Pig,Narration,"Night falls and the lights on the ferris wheel are turned on. Dipper lies down on the ""Slopey Toss"""
The Time Traveler's Pig,Pizza Guy,"Uh, are you gonna move?"

The Time Traveler's Pig,Mabel,"(Holds up Waddles, who is dressed as a doctor)Paging Dr. Waddles, we got a boy here with a broken heart. Haha! Come on, man. These are the jokes."
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,"Mabel, do you ever wish you could go back and undo just one mistake?"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Mabel,"Nope! I do everything right, all the time!(Moves Waddles' arms around)Wa! Wa! Ee! Ee! Wawawa!"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,"I mean Wendy only went out with Robbie because he was there with the ice, and she only needed ice because of the baseball, and I would've had the ice if it wasn't for...(gasp)that guy!(to Blendin Blandin)Hey, you! Toolbelt! You ruined my life!(walks up to him)"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Blendin,Huh?
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,Don't huh me! I've seen you before! What's your deal? Are you following us around?

The Time Traveler's Pig,Blendin,"Uh, NO!! Who told you that?! MEMORY WIPE!(Throws baby wipe in Mabel's face)"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Mabel,(Looks at it)This is a baby wipe.
The Time Traveler's Pig,Blendin,"All right, you've cornered me. I'm... a time traveler."
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,"So wait a minute, if you're from the future, do you have like a time machine, or something?"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Blendin,That's... kinda how it works.
The Time Traveler's Pig,Robbie and Wendy,(Riding the Ferris wheel)
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,Can I borrow it?
The Time Traveler's Pig,Narration,Commercial Break
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,"Come on, can I use yourtime machinejust once?"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Blendin,"Out of the question! You know, this is sensitive extremely complicated time equipment.(pulls out tape measure to show them)"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,It looks like a tape measure.
The Time Traveler's Pig,Blendin,You shut your time-mouth!
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,(to Mabel:)This making any sense to you?
The Time Traveler's Pig,Mabel,I think he's just crazy.
The Time Traveler's Pig,Blendin,"Oh! You don't believe me?(pulls tape measure, disappears, then reappears a few seconds later in old fashioned clothes)Guess where I was!"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper and Mabel,Whoa!
The Time Traveler's Pig,Blendin,"That's right! 15 years ago there was a costume shop right here! One second.(disappears, then reappears in his normal suit, which is flaming)Ah! Aw, heck! Pat! Pat down!(pats the fire out)"

The Time Traveler's Pig,Blendin,"Blendin Blandin, Time Anomaly Removal Crew year twenty sñeventy-twelve. My mission is to stop a series of time anomalies that are suppose to happen at this very location! But-but I don't see any anomalies! I don't know if it's some kind of paradox, or I'm just really tired...(sits down)"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,"You know, you sound like you could use a break."
The Time Traveler's Pig,Mabel,"Definitely, definitely. Might we recommend one of the various attractions at the Mystery Fair?"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Blendin,"(gets up)You know what? What the heck! I'm worth it!(starts to leave)But I've got my eye on you! Ehhh... ehhh...(arrives at the barrel ride, which Soos is operating)One please."
The Time Traveler's Pig,Soos,"Uh, sorry dude, but you're gonna have to take your belt off for the ride. One of your tools might fly off and accidentally fix something."
The Time Traveler's Pig,Blendin,(Gives it to him)Guard it with your life.
The Time Traveler's Pig,Soos,"I will watch it like a hawk, dude.(Starts ride and sets the belt on the barrel at his side)"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Blendin,Woooooo! Yaaaaaaayyy! Weeheee!

The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,"Here it is, Mabel. Our ticket to any moment in history."
The Time Traveler's Pig,Mabel,Let's go get two dodos and force them to make out!
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,"No! We gotta be smart about this. All that paradox talk kinda freaked me out. All I'm gonna do is go back and fix my one mistake. If I don't miss that base ball throw, I won't hit Wendy in the eye, and Robbie won't comfort her, and they won't start going out."
The Time Traveler's Pig,Mabel,"I'm coming, too! I wanna relive the greatest moment in my life: winning Waddles.(kisses Waddles)"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,(pulls out tape)See you later.

The Time Traveler's Pig,Ball game carnie,You only get one chance.
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,"That's what you think... One panda-duck, comin' right up! Okay, Dipper, second chance, don't mess this up.(throws ball, knocks down all the bottles)Yes!(The ball hits the back of the stand and bounces back and hits Wendy in the eye.)"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Wendy,AAAAHH! MY EYE!
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,What?!
The Time Traveler's Pig,Wendy,Does it look swollen?
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,(looks at hands)That's so weird...
The Time Traveler's Pig,Wendy,"Oh, hey Robbie."
The Time Traveler's Pig,Robbie,"So anyway, we've been hanging out a lot and I've been wondering if, uh, you would want to go out with me?"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Wendy,"Yeah, I guess so."
The Time Traveler's Pig,Robbie,Sweet!
The Time Traveler's Pig,Narration,Dipper's eye twitches
The Time Traveler's Pig,Narration,Mabel is feeding Waddles a caramel apple while Dipper talks to her
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,The exact same thing happened twice; it was spooky.
The Time Traveler's Pig,Mabel,"Oo, maybe it's a time-curse. Waddles, can you say ""time-curse""?"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Waddles,Oink-oink!
The Time Traveler's Pig,Mabel,Ooooooohhhhhhh!(picks him up)Your face is so fat!
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,"It is possible that the forces of time naturally conspire to undo any new outcomes? No, I just need to try again. Third time's the charm!"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Mabel,How hard could it be?
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper and Mabel,(pull the tape and disappear)
The Time Traveler's Pig,Narration,A crowd with torches walks around
The Time Traveler's Pig,Sprott,Find the witch!
The Time Traveler's Pig,Narration,"Montage of Dipper trying to win the game without hitting Wendy in the eye, and failing every time"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,"Wendy, how badly do you want that stuffed animal thing?"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Wendy,"More than anything in the world, Dipper."
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,"Ahkay...(throws ball, which bounces off the back, hits the carnie, the stuffed animal, and a bag of balls, breaking the bag open and spilling the balls on Wendy)"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Wendy,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!
The Time Traveler's Pig,Robbie,(helps her up and shakes his head at Dipper)
The Time Traveler's Pig,Mabel,(riding the ferris wheel with Waddles)I LOVE MY PIG!!
The Time Traveler's Pig,Narration,"Mabel and Dipper are waiting near a popcorn machine, which Dipper is writing on."
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,...I just thought the wind speed... factoring cotton candy...
The Time Traveler's Pig,Mabel,"Face it, Dipper, you're obviously fated to have a bad day at the fair, just like I'm fated to be with Waddles.(shows him the sweater she's knitting, which has a pig on the front)"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,Like there's one variable missing...
The Time Traveler's Pig,Mabel,What's a variable?
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,"That's it! I've figured out to win the toss, not hit Wendy, and stop Wendy and Robbie from going out!"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Mabel,Great! I'm gonna go win my pig again.(walks off)
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,"Whoa whoa whoa, you can't leave, I need you for my plan!"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Mabel,But what about Waddles?
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,"It'll just take a few minutes, let's go!(pulls her away. Later, Dipper is at the game, looking at the wind speeds and everything)"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Wendy,"Are you gonna go, man?"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,And a-one and a-two and a-uh!(throws ball straight up)
The Time Traveler's Pig,Wendy,Ah! Dude! You missed!
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,"Did I?(the ball comes back down, rolls down the tent, flies up, hits the windgage, rolls down a pipe which Mabel lifts up, and flies at the dunk tank target)"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Crowd,Huh!
The Time Traveler's Pig,Narration,The ball hits the target and nothing happens
The Time Traveler's Pig,Crowd,Aaww!
The Time Traveler's Pig,Stan,Ahaha!
The Time Traveler's Pig,Narration,"The ball comes back and flies between Dipper and Wendy, knocks down all the cans, and bounces off the back of the stand, and breaks through the top of the tent"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Ball game Carnie,"Yourstuffed creature of indeterminate species, miss.(gives Wendy Duck-panda)"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Wendy,"(squeezes it)Oh, awesome!"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,(catches the ball in his hat)
The Time Traveler's Pig,Robbie,"There you are, Wendy!"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Wendy,"Hi, Robbie."
The Time Traveler's Pig,Robbie,So I was wondering if I... you a...
The Time Traveler's Pig,Wendy,Look what Dipper got for me!
The Time Traveler's Pig,Robbie,Pfft. Whatever. Can't even tell what species it is. Stupid.(pulls hood over face and walks away)
The Time Traveler's Pig,Wendy,What's his deal? Looks like I came to the fair with the right guy.
The Time Traveler's Pig,Bell game carnie,We have a winner!
The Time Traveler's Pig,Mabel,"(coming up behind Dipper. Dipper gives her a thumbs up)Anytime, broseph. Now to win my pig. AH!"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Sprott,(to Pacifica:)It's all yours! No one else's! Ol' 15-Poundy. Yours. Forever!
The Time Traveler's Pig,Pacifica,(Links leash onto 15-Poundy and pulls him away)
The Time Traveler's Pig,15-Poundy,(Disobeys Pacifica)SQEEEEEEEEEEEEAAALLLL!!!
The Time Traveler's Pig,Mabel,(Screams and runs away)
The Time Traveler's Pig,Narration,Dipper and Wendy are riding the Tunnel of Love and Corn-dogs and laughing
The Time Traveler's Pig,Wendy,"That was even more awesome the third time around! Funnel cake! Let's go get some, Dipper!(runs off)"

The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,I'll just wait until you're done.
The Time Traveler's Pig,Mabel,I'm done.
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,"Okay, what is wrong?"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Mabel,"We messed up the timeline! Pacifica saw the flyer and won Waddles before I did! She TOOK Waddles, Dipper!"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,"Oh, Mabel, I'm sorry."
The Time Traveler's Pig,Mabel,It's okay. We just need to go back(takes time machine from Dipper)and do things differently.
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,"Mabel! Wait.(Takes time machine back)Look. I did the math. In any other timeline, Wendy ends up going out with Robbie. I can't mess up this day again!"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Mabel,"But if we don't go, then I'll lose Waddles forever!(Tries to take the time machine back)"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,Hey!(Tries to pull the time machine away from Mabel)
The Time Traveler's Pig,Mabel,"Give it back!(Dipper pulls harder, causing himself and Mabel to fall to the ground)"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Narration,"Another car comes by and catches the tape, pulling it out a long way before letting go. Dipper and Mabel land flat on their faces on a dirt path."
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,When are we?
The Time Traveler's Pig,Mabel,"The real question is:whenare we? Oh wait, did you already–"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,"Yeah, I already–"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Mabel,Alright.
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,It's the same thing. Do you hear that?
The Time Traveler's Pig,Buffalo,(stampede)
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper and Mabel,AAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!(run and fall off a cliff)AAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!! (fall through the roof of a caravan and onto some flour)

The Time Traveler's Pig,Mabel,Tallow? What?
The Time Traveler's Pig,Boy,"Her mouth is filled with silver, mother!"

The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,"Mabel, we can't start messing with the past!"

The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,(takes time machine from her)Give me that! I'm gonna set the timeline right!(pulls tape and he and Mabel disappear. They appear in front of a large carnivorous dinosaur)
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper and Mabel,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!

The Time Traveler's Pig,Mabel,But what about Waddles? He was my soulmate!
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,You said that about a ball of yarn once! Do you really want Wendy to date Robbie?
The Time Traveler's Pig,Mabel,I don't know...(starts to hit her head against the totem pole)
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,"You're not guilt-tripping me, Mabel. Not this time."
The Time Traveler's Pig,Mabel,(doesn't stop hitting her head against the pole)
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,"Come on, Mabel, I know you. You're gonna forget about this in a day!(takes time machine out of pocket)Here! Hey!

The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,(watches Mabel)Uh... grrrr!(goes back. He is walking up to the ball game with Wendy)
The Time Traveler's Pig,Wendy,"I don't know if it's a duck or a panda, but I want one!"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,"(Sigh)Wendy, I just wanted to say that, well I just wanted say that people makes mistakes, and when they do, you should forgive them. And also that tight pants are overrated."
The Time Traveler's Pig,Wendy,"Dude, you lost me."

The Time Traveler's Pig,Waddles,"(Oinks ""thank you"" two times and turns body around and kicks his legs)"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Pacifica,(Being pecked by a chicken)Ow-Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!...
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,"I couldn't break your heart, Mabel. Besides, there's no way Wendy can date Robbie all summer, right?"

The Time Traveler's Pig,Dundgren,You are under arrest for violations of the Time Traveler's Code of Conduct.(handcuffs him and leads him away)
The Time Traveler's Pig,Blendin,"It was those kids! And their leader, Waddles!"
The Time Traveler's Pig,Lolph,"That's a pig, Blendin."

The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,"Wait, Mabel; I think it was us."
The Time Traveler's Pig,Mabel,"Ugh, my brain hurts."
The Time Traveler's Pig,Dipper,"Oh, geez, I gotta deal with this all summer?"

The Time Traveler's Pig,Mabel,I'm on it.(points Waddles at the apple)
The Time Traveler's Pig,Waddles,"HUH!(runs at Robbie, making him drop the apple. Waddles eats it.)"

Fight Fighters,Stan,"You know, studies show that keeping a ladder in the house is more dangerous than a loaded gun. That's why I own ten guns, in case some maniac tries to sneak in with a ladder."
Fight Fighters,Mabel,"(Suspiciously:)Grunkle Stan, why you ackin' so cray-cray?"
Fight Fighters,Stan,"YOU'RE the one who's ""ackin' cray-cray!""(Leaving)I gotta go now."
Fight Fighters,Mabel,Why would Grunkle Stan be so weirded out by ladders? Of course! I think he has a secret fear of heights! We'll have to test him to be sure! Or we could leave well enough alone... Nah!
Fight Fighters,Narration,"Cut to arcade, where Soos is playingNORT. His avatar falls over."
Fight Fighters,Soos,"Man, I wonder what it would be like to go inside a video game for real!(Drills his way into the arcade game itself)I should have thought of this years ago!(Tries to squeeze in)"

Fight Fighters,Dipper,"(Sighs)That's easy for you to say, you have more than one life. Ugh, I wish one of these guys would fight Robbie for me.(Starts to insert another coin, but drops it and it rolls onto the floor. He bends down to pick it up and notices something written on the machine, and brushes off the dust, revealing the text; Reading message:)""To unleash ultimate power?"" I do like things that are ultimate.(Enters code)Back, back, hold, forward, back, forward, down, hold, quarter circle, forward, triple punch!(Machine shuts down)I guess it didn't work.(Screen flares back to life)Uhhh Soos?"

Fight Fighters,Rumble,(Spots a change machine)CHANGE MACHINE! CHANGE ME INTO A POWERFUL WOLF!! HWAAAAH!!!(Smashes change machine)
Fight Fighters,Dipper,"(To himself:)With Rumble around, Robbie will be so scared, I won't even need to fight him. I've got the world's greatest fighter to be my bodyguard!"
Fight Fighters,Rumble,(Flashes red)I need power ups!
Fight Fighters,Dipper,This is so amazing! I gotta show Soos!(Looks around)Soos?
Fight Fighters,Narration,Amanwalks up to NORT machine and screams upon seeing Soos literally inside the game.
Fight Fighters,Soos,"Help, I'm trapped in the game! It was cool in theory but in practice it was really boring."
Fight Fighters,Man,(Screams and runs away)
Fight Fighters,Soos,It's not just a game anymore!
Fight Fighters,Narration,Cut back to Mystery Shack.
Fight Fighters,Mabel,"Alright, Waddles. It's time to begin. Operation Get Stan Over His Fear of Heights! I came up with that name.(Walks over to where Stan is sleeping on the couch; to Stan:)HAPPY GREAT UNCLE'S DAY!"
Fight Fighters,Stan,(Stan wakes up and is handed a present by Mabel)Huh? Is it Great Uncle's Day?
Fight Fighters,Mabel,"Ha ha, yeah of course it's not a day I made up."
Fight Fighters,Stan,"(Opens the box and pulls out high heels)High heels? You shouldn't have. Seriously, wha- what? What is this?"
Fight Fighters,Mabel,What's wrong? Are you saying these heels are TOO high? Do they make you uncomfortable? Hmm?
Fight Fighters,Stan,Maybe.
Fight Fighters,Mabel,Admit it! Admit you have a fear of heights!
Fight Fighters,Stan,"(Adjusting television's antennae)What? That's why you bought me these? You should be ashamed of yourself! And on Great Uncle's Day no less. But no, I don't have a ""fear of heights."""
Fight Fighters,TV announcer,"We now return to ""World's Most Terrifying Skydiving!"""
Fight Fighters,Stan,Ah! Ah! Turn it off!(Trips over the dinosaur skull)So I have a fear of heights. Is that really so cray-cray?
Fight Fighters,Narration,Cut to the kitchen.
Fight Fighters,Rumble,(Attacks fly; laughs)
Fight Fighters,Dipper,"(Checking the refrigerator)Well, we don't have any traditional power ups: turkey legs, pizza boxes, or gold rings. How about... half a taco?"
Fight Fighters,Rumble,"Place it, on the floor."
Fight Fighters,Narration,"Dipper puts the taco on the floor, Rumble looks at it, it disappears and then reappears in his power-ups menu."
Fight Fighters,Dipper,I wish I could do that!
Fight Fighters,Rumble,Now I must defeat the world's greatest fight-fighters. Take me to the Soviet Union!
Fight Fighters,Dipper,That's gonna be tough... for a number of reasons. But I do know a fighter here in Gravity Falls.
Fight Fighters,Rumble,Maximum Power?
Fight Fighters,Dipper,(Gives Rumble one of Robbie's band posters)His name is Robbie V. and he's kinda like my arch enemy.
Fight Fighters,Rumble,Did he killyour father?
Fight Fighters,Dipper,Well he's dating the girl I like and he posts a really annoying amount of status updates.
Fight Fighters,Rumble,(Crumples the poster)And then he killed your father!
Fight Fighters,Dipper,"Uh, sure. Anyway, I was hoping you could, y'know, scare him off for me so I don't have to fight the guy."
Fight Fighters,Rumble,"Hahaha! Your question makes my shoulders bounce! Fire ball!(Shoots aHadoukenat the window, does the actions as he says them:)Uppercut! Downer-cut! Bowl of PUNCH!(Drinks from punch bowl and then smashes it)"
Fight Fighters,Dipper,So you'll protect me from Robbie?
Fight Fighters,Rumble,Challenge accepted! Press start!(A start button appears)
Fight Fighters,Dipper,"(Presses it)Uh oh, I think I hear my uncle. Stay perfectly still!"
Fight Fighters,Narration,"Pans out, showing Dipper standing next to Rumble, who is rocking back and forth in a fighting stance."
Fight Fighters,Dipper,I said stay still.
Fight Fighters,Rumble,(Still rocking back and forth)This is as still as I can stay!
Fight Fighters,Narration,Cut to attic.
Fight Fighters,Mabel,How am I gonna get Grunkle Stan over his fear of heights?
Fight Fighters,Dipper,(Walks in with Rumble)Hey Mabel. Have you met Rumble yet? He's my new bodyguard.
Fight Fighters,Rumble,The child gave me a taco!
Fight Fighters,Mabel,"Wow! He's got a crazy voice! Here, say these words.(Writes words on a piece of paper and hands them to Rumble)"
Fight Fighters,Rumble,(Reading:)Effer...vescent! Apple..fritter! RIBOFLAVIN!!
Fight Fighters,Dipper,"Mabel, he's not a toy, he's a fighting machine. I'm gonna get him to defend me from Robbie."
Fight Fighters,Mabel,Isn't that kinda like cheating?
Fight Fighters,Dipper,"I guess so. Well, I'll see you after the fight."
Fight Fighters,Rumble,(Reading:)POOP! POOP AND BUTTS!
Fight Fighters,Narration,Cut to Dipper and Rumble out onMain Street.
Fight Fighters,Rumble,Tell me my opponent's special moves.
Fight Fighters,Dipper,"Don't worry. As soon as he sees you, he's gonna wet his pants."
Fight Fighters,Rumble,His wet pants will be no match FOR THIS!(Picks up a metal pipe and whips it around)
Fight Fighters,Dipper,Whoa! Where'd that came from?
Fight Fighters,Rumble,I punched an oil drum!
Fight Fighters,Dipper,"Trust me, you won't need that. Just give him a good scare."
Fight Fighters,Rumble,Yes...(Picks up a sword)WITH THIS!!!(Swings sword around)

Fight Fighters,Stan,"Eh, beats just sittin' around being old.(Gets up, pauses and then starts to sit back down)Wait a minute... you're not planning on taking me somewhere super high up, are you?"
Fight Fighters,Mabel,Grunkle Stan! I wouldnever!(Puts on scout's honor sweater)Scout's honor!
Fight Fighters,Stan,"Alright, let's go."
Fight Fighters,Narration,"Stan walks away, and Mabel turns around to reveal the back of the sweater has crossed fingers on it. She chuckles mischievously and pulls her tucked hair out of the sweater so that it's covering the crossed fingers. Cut to Circle Park. Robbie is waiting. Three bells ring. Robbie approaches Dipper."
Fight Fighters,Robbie,"Well, well, well! Look who decided to show up! I thought you'd chicken out. You ready to settle this like men?"
Fight Fighters,Dipper,"Look dude, I don't think you want to fight me. Let's just call this thing off before someone gets hurt."
Fight Fighters,Robbie,"Youscared, huh? Is that it?"
Fight Fighters,Dipper,"Okay, dude! You asked for it!(Snaps his fingers)"
Fight Fighters,Rumble,(Comes out from the dark and assumes fighting pose)
Fight Fighters,Robbie,Who's your friend? And why is he...blurry?
Fight Fighters,Dipper,This happens to be the greatest warrior that ever lived!
Fight Fighters,Robbie,"Yeah, right! Hey Eye Patch, what did the kid promise you? More tape for your forearms?(Laughs)"
Fight Fighters,Rumble,"HOW CAN YOU LAUGH, WHEN YOU KILLED THIS BOY'S FATHER?!?!!"
Fight Fighters,Robbie,"(Confused)Wait, what?"
Fight Fighters,Dipper,"I'm giving you one last chance. Back down, or this guy's gonna go nuts."
Fight Fighters,Robbie,"How 'bout YOU back down, kid?"
Fight Fighters,Dipper,You asked for it. Rumble... Go!
Fight Fighters,Robbie,"(Laughs; ducks Rumble's punch)What the-?(Tries to run away, but Rumble picks him up)Whoa, woah, woah, what is- what's happening?"

Fight Fighters,Son,"I love you, Dad."
Fight Fighters,Narration,"Robbie runs by screaming, and Rumble chases him. Then the scene changes to Rumble's bonus round, causing Rumble to destroy the car. Rumble gets a perfect score. The boy drops down on his knees."
Fight Fighters,Son,(His words appear above him as he says them)Oh! My car.
Fight Fighters,Man,We'll just buy another one.
Fight Fighters,Son,I love being rich.

Ungh!(Kicks bookcase and 3 falls down)There's gotta be some way to get taller.(Looks through book)Let's see...(Reading:)""Legends of miniature buffalo and giant squirrels have led me to believe there are height-altering properties hidden deep within theforest."""
Little Dipper,Narration,Scene fades to Dipper walking through the forest
Little Dipper,Dipper,"Hmm...(Trips the a deep slope)Ooh! Ah! Ow! Agh! Aagh.(Notices tiny deer standing on his chest)Whoa!(He sees the tiny deer trot to a group of tiny deer. A tiny bald eagle passes by Dipper's mouth)Huh?(Gasps)Is that mountain lion tiny or just far away in perspective?(Mountain lion growls and pounces)PERSPECTIVE! PERSPECTIVE! AAAAAAH!(Mountain lion leaps and is frozen in a beam of pink light, which shrinks it; Dipper laughs from being tickled; mountain lion meows and bites his finger)It still hurts, butless!(Walks over togiant crystals)Whoa.(Sees a butterfly pass through the pink light and shrink, then the blue light and grow; it knocks over a tree)What the heck?(Cuts a crystal off with a Swiss army knife)"
Little Dipper,Narration,Cut to Dipper and Mabel's room
Little Dipper,Dipper,"(Dipper had took a piece of the crystal he found, and ties it in front of aflashlight. It shines blue, then Dipper rotates it so it shines pink)Smaller.(Makes chess piece smaller)Bigger.(Makes chess piece bigger. It breaks through the roof)TOO BIG!"

Little Dipper,Dipper,"What can I say, sis? Growth spurt."
Little Dipper,Mabel,"Yeah, mine happened first. I'm gonna be taller in the end. It's science, Dipper."
Little Dipper,Dipper,What? But we're the same height now.
Little Dipper,Mabel,Alpha-twin! Alpha-twin!
Little Dipper,Dipper,Oh yeah? Something tells me I've got another growth spurt comin' on right now.(Walks away. Cut to him growing himself taller in the attic when Mabel kicks the door open)
Little Dipper,Mabel,"Give it up, Dipper!(Sees that he is much taller than her; gasp)What happened?"
Little Dipper,Dipper,"Y'know, puberty and stuff."
Little Dipper,Mabel,"It doesn't make any sense. Just a second ago you were- WAIT A MINUTE! This is some kinda magicky thing. Isn't it? Was it a wizard or something? There's a wizard in this closet, isn't there? ISN'T THERE?"
Little Dipper,Dipper,What? No!
Little Dipper,Mabel,You're telling me that there isnota wizard in this closet. You're telling me that if I open this doorright now-

Little Dipper,Stan,"(Opens door)Oy, you."
Little Dipper,Gideon,"Oh, howdy Stanford! Listen closely. Inside this jar, I have one thousandcursed Egyptian super termites. Hand over thedeedto your property or I'll smash this jar with a bat, and they'll devour this shack with you inside!"
Little Dipper,Stan,"Hey, what's that?"
Little Dipper,Gideon,(Turns around)Huh?
Little Dipper,Stan,(Smashes the jar of termites and they attack Gideon)
Little Dipper,Gideon,"Oh, no! Aaaah! Get it off! Awww!(Runs away)"
Little Dipper,Stan,"Ha, ha, ha! Hey, Soos, get in here! I wanna take pictures of this!"
Little Dipper,Gideon,"Y'all may have won the battle, but mark my words, Stanford! Your family has a weak spot, and I'm gonna find it! Ahh! My hair!(Runs away)"
Little Dipper,Narration,Cut back to Dipper and Mabel's room.
Little Dipper,Mabel,Does he only respond to incantations? Expecto wizarium! Wizzle! Wizar--
Little Dipper,Dipper,It's not a wizard!(Grabs the flashlight from the shelf)I grew myself using this magic flashlight!
Little Dipper,Mabel,(Looks behind herself and at the flashlight) ...Lemme see that thing!

Little Dipper,Mabel,Ahh!(Attacks Dipper and fixes her head)
Little Dipper,Dipper,"Hey, give it back!"
Little Dipper,Mabel,(Yells)Never!
Little Dipper,Narration,The flashlight flies out of their hands.
Little Dipper,Gideon,"Curse the Pines family! Curse Stan! Curse Dipper! Curse--(The flashlight lands in front of him)My, my, what delightful manner of a doohickery is this?"
Little Dipper,Mabel,Maybe he didn't see us use it and doesn't know it's a magic flashlight that can grow and shrink things.
Little Dipper,Narration,"Camera pans to show that they are standing in front of Gideon, and therefore definitely does know what it is now."
Little Dipper,Dipper,Really?
Little Dipper,Gideon,"(Turns the flashlight on and off)Click, boop.(laughs mischievously)"
Little Dipper,Dipper and Mabel,"No, no, no--!!"
Little Dipper,Gideon,"(Shrinks them, from Dipper and Mabel's view:)Gwa ha ha ha ha!(He bellows with laughter. From normal view he is giggling:)Hee hee hee, woo hoo hoo hoo hoo!(Puts a jar over the twins)"

Little Dipper,Mabel,I know! (Puts Gummy Koala in her sweater's pocket) I will see you later.
Little Dipper,Dipper,"Okay, how are we going to do this? Gideon's got magic and, like, azillioninches on us. On the bright side, at least we're finally the same height again."
Little Dipper,Mabel,Actually...

Little Dipper,Dipper,(Looks at Gideon's hairbrush) I have a plan.
Little Dipper,Dipper and Mabel,"(Slide down a rope made of Gideon's hairs; they hide in a shoe and peek out at Gideon and Bud, who are eating ice cream; the flashlight sits on the table)"
Little Dipper,Gideon,"Clean me! (Bud wipes Gideon's face with a cloth) Father, could you give widdle ol' me a ride to the Mystery Shack?"
Little Dipper,Bud,"Oh, I'd love to, sugar-pie, but I have a heck of a lot of cars to sell, I do! (Tickles Gideon) I do!"

Little Dipper,Bud,(Feeling ashamed)Ticklin' is no laughin' matter.
Little Dipper,Gideon,"(Pats him, satisfied)There we go."
Little Dipper,Bud,Do you still need a ride?
Little Dipper,Gideon,"I'll just take the BUS! (Knocks table over, kicks door open and slams it on his way out)"

Little Dipper,Narration,A bus drives by and Gideon enters.
Little Dipper,Dipper,He's heading to shrink Stan!
Little Dipper,Mabel,"Oh flying discount dollar, if only you could fly us back to the Mystery Shack."
Little Dipper,Dipper,"Maybe it can. (Pulls out Swiss army knife with scissors, cuts the rope freeing the discount dollar and they start flying away)"

Little Dipper,Dipper,"We're just in time, (points to the arriving bus that Gideon is on) but how are we going to stop him? (woodpecker pecks his head) Ah shoo ah ha ah!"
Little Dipper,Mabel,(Sees a wire leading to the roof)Leave that to Mabel.
Little Dipper,Gideon,"(Walks toward the Shack while humming)I'm comin' for ya, Stanford!"
Little Dipper,Mabel,"(Drops Gummy Koala in his hair)I'm sorry, gummy friend."
Little Dipper,Dipper,It's for the greater good.

Little Dipper,Mabel,"Quick, get in front and I'll re-grow you."
Little Dipper,Dipper,"Okay. Wait, you're gonna grow us back to equal height right?"
Little Dipper,Mabel,Dipper! That doesn't matter right now.
Little Dipper,Dipper,"Well if it doesn't matter, then why don't you just do it?"
Little Dipper,Mabel,UGH! Why are you acting so weird? Why can't you just accept that I'm a little bit taller than you?
Little Dipper,Dipper,"Oh,I'macting weird? You're the one who keeps calling me names and stuff."
Little Dipper,Mabel,"Oh, what? You mean like little-"

Little Dipper,"Dipper, Mabel, and Soos",(Try to break out of the jar)
Little Dipper,Mabel,(Sees Gideon's picture on his school ID and sticks out tongue and makes a razzberry at it)
Little Dipper,Soos,"I guess I kinda Soos'd that one up, didn't I?"
Little Dipper,Dipper,"It's not your fault, Soos, I'm the guy who put together that shrinking device.(To Mabel:)I guess it's just you kept teasing me, Mabel, like all day. What was that all about?"
Little Dipper,Mabel,"(Gives him the notebook which keeps track of wins and losses)I guess it's that, you're better than me at like everything, and you always rub it in my face... Chess, checkers, ping pong... I guess I finally felt like I was winning at something for once."
Little Dipper,Dipper,"Oh man, now I feel like a big jerk."

Summerween,Dipper,Goodbye loser candy!(Throws candy out the window)
Summerween,Narration,View from outside with heavy breathing. Door bell rings.
Summerween,Stan,(Offscreen:)Trick-or-treaters. Quick! Give'em that terrible candy.
Summerween,Dipper,(Opens door)Happy Summerw-AHH!(Spills candy bowl)
Summerween,Robbie Valentino,"'Sup, squirt."
Summerween,Wendy Corduroy,Hey Dipper!
Summerween,Dipper,"Wendy! Ha ha!(Backs up into staircase)Ow... Wha-what's up, guys?"
Summerween,Wendy,I left my jacket here. Again.
Summerween,Robbie,What's with the candy? You're goin' trick-or-treating or something?
Summerween,Dipper,"Well actually I, uh —"
Summerween,Wendy,"Shut up, Robbie, of course he's not going trick-or-treating."
Summerween,Dipper,"No! Uh, yeah.(Hides the scrapbook)Trick-or-treating is for babies.(Laughs nervously)I guess."
Summerween,Wendy,"You should come to this party with us.Tambry'sparents are out of town, and it's gonna be OFF THE CHAIN."
Summerween,Robbie,Not surprisedyoudidn't hear about it.(Hands Dipper a flyer)
Summerween,Dipper,"Hey guys, wait! Maybe I'll see you at the party."
Summerween,Robbie,If you're not too busy playing dress up.
Summerween,Wendy,(Elbows Robbie)It's at 9! Don't forget!(Van engine rumbles and van drives off)
Summerween,Dipper,(Sighs)How am I gonna tell Mabel?
Summerween,Narration,"Wolf howls in the distance. Mabel is in the lobby, dressed as strawberry jelly. Candy and Grenda are also here, dressed as a taffy and witch, respectively."
Summerween,Mabel,"Grunkle Stan, these are my best friends,CandyandGrenda."
Summerween,Candy Chiu,I am so sweet I could eat myself.
Summerween,Grenda Grendinator,"Hello, Mr. Pines!"
Summerween,Stan,"(Is dressed as a vampire)You got a cold, honey? Something wrong with your voice there?"
Summerween,Grenda,What do you mean? Why would you say that?
Summerween,Stan,(Waves his cape and walks away)
Summerween,Candy,IsWaddlescoming with us?
Summerween,Mabel,"I wish he could, but he's got somevery important meetings to attend!"
Summerween,Waddles,(Walks in with a suit attached to his chest. He runs up to Mabel)
Summerween,Mabel,"File these documents under 'I', for ""I have a curly tail!"""
Summerween,Grenda,(Grenda and Candy laughing)What about your brother?
Summerween,Mabel,"Oh man guys, justwaituntil you see Dipper's costume! It's amazing! Here he comes now!"
Summerween,Dipper,(Walks down the stairs dressed normally)
Summerween,Candy,That is a very good Dipper costume.
Summerween,Mabel,"What the hey-hey bro-bro, where's your costume?"
Summerween,Dipper,"Look, I can't go trick-or-treating. I'm... uh,reallysick.(Fake coughs)Must have been that bad candy.(Falls on floor)You go on without me."
Summerween,Mabel,"Fight through it, man! Where's your Summerween spirit?"
Summerween,Narration,Someone knocks on the door. Dipper opens it.
Summerween,Trickster,Trick-or-treat.
Summerween,Dipper,"Dude, really? You're a little old for this, man. Sorry."
Summerween,Trickster,"But wait, I— (Door slams)"
Summerween,Mabel,Why'd you close the door?
Summerween,Dipper,"I told you, Mabel, I'm just not feeling it tonight.(Fake coughs)"
Summerween,Mabel,I think a little trick-or-treating will make you feel better.
Summerween,Dipper,I'm not trick-or-treating!
Summerween,Narration,Knocking on door again.
Summerween,Dipper,"(Opens door)Look man, just go to another house!(Slams door)"
Summerween,Mabel,Dipper! Where's your Summerween hospitality?
Summerween,Narration,Knocking on door.
Summerween,Dipper,I'm not getting that.
Summerween,Mabel,"Well, I am!(Opens door)I apologize for my brother, he came down with a case of the grumpy-grumps."
Summerween,Trickster,SILENCE! You have insulted me! For this you must pay... with your LIVES.
Summerween,Mabel,"Aww, what a cute little mask! You're a funny guy, aren't you?"
Summerween,Trickster,"(Enters the Shack)Funny, am I?"
Summerween,Gorney,Twik-owr-tweet! My name is Gorney.
Summerween,Trickster,(Grabs and eats Gorney)
Summerween,Gorney,Remember meeee!
Summerween,"Dipper, Mabel, Candy and Grenda",(Scream)
Summerween,Grenda,Gorney!
Summerween,Trickster,"There's only one way for you to avoid his fate.(Pokes Candy on the head, Candy clutches Dipper in fright)I need a treat. If you can collect 500 pieces of candy, and bring it to me before the last jack-o-melon goes out...(Blows out jack-o-melon)I will let you live."
Summerween,Dipper,Five hundred treats in one night? That's impossible!
Summerween,Trickster,"The choice is yours, children. You must trick-or-treat... Or DIE. Bwahahaha.(Crawls across the Shack's roof and out of sight)"
Summerween,Dipper,"Oh my gosh Mabel, do you know what this means?"
Summerween,Mabel,I do. It means you have to come trick-or-treating! Yay!(Shakes Dipper)
Summerween,Candy,Who was that guy?
Summerween,Mabel,It's the legend Soos told us about. It's true!
Summerween,Grenda,"(Shaking Dipper)What do we do, what do we DO?!"
Summerween,Soos,"What's goin' on out here, dudes? I heard a ruckus. Hehe. That's a funny word. Ruckus."
Summerween,Dipper,"Soos, a monster is making us trick-or-treat or else he's gonna eat us!"
Summerween,Candy,"I got a picture!(Shows Soos a picture she took on her phone; the picture has a pink and fluffy outline, stickers, and a Korean word.)"
Summerween,Soos,"The Summerween Trickster! Oh man, dude, you guys are in crazy bonkers trouble."
Summerween,Dipper,How are we gonna get that much candy in one night? There's no way!
Summerween,Mabel,"(Clapping)Listen up, people. Now some might say that being cursed by a blood-thirsty holiday monster is a bad thing."
Summerween,Grenda,I wet myself.
Summerween,Mabel,"But that monster messed with the wrong crew. With Candy's spirit, Grenda's strength, Dipper's brains, and... Soos here, we'll get 500 pieces of candy and have fun doing it too, even if it takes all night!"
Summerween,"Soos, Candy and Grenda",(Cheer)
Summerween,Mabel,To the streets!
Summerween,Dipper,"All night? But-but I'm sick, remember?"
Summerween,Mabel,"Dipper, what's worse: getting eaten by a horrifying monster, or coming trick-or-treating with us?"
Summerween,Dipper,Well..
Summerween,Mabel,Come on!(Grabs Dipper by the arms)
Summerween,Stan,"(Putting in fake fangs)Ah, Summerween. Those kids aren't gonna know what hit 'em!(Looks through the window and laughs evilly)"
Summerween,Kids,(Kids ring doorbell)Trick-or-treat.
Summerween,Stan,"(Opens door)What can I do for y — uh, ugh. Oh no! No! Augahhh!(Face melts off, revealing a skull; kids scream and run away; Stan reveals the skull was actually a mask)Ah haha! Huh?(Notices that two kids haven't left)"
Summerween,Soldier Kid,Can we have candy now?
Summerween,Stan,"What's the matter with you kids? That was the scariest thing you've ever seen, right?"
Summerween,Narration,"Kids look at each other and motion a ""so-so"" with their hands."
Summerween,Stan,"Well have you seenthis! Ah!(Pulls hotdog chain from costume)Guts! Real, very real guts!"
Summerween,Mummy Kid,"Uh, we've been watching horror movies since we were like, two years old."
Summerween,Soldier Kid,"Yeah, we're not scared."
Summerween,Stan,"Oh, you will be.(Covers face with cape menacingly)Youwillbe."
Summerween,Narration,View of watertower with bats flying by. Trick-or-treaters seen from above.
Summerween,Manly Dan,"(He and hissonsare dressed as vikings)For glory, my children, CHARGE!(They smash through door with a battering ram. People inside scream)"
Summerween,Sheriff Blubs,(Dressed as Durland)You make a great me.
Summerween,Deputy Durland,"(Dressed as Blubs)No, you make a great me."
Summerween,Blubs,"No, you do.(Durland giggles)"
Summerween,Dipper,I don't understand why we can't just buy our candy and be done with it.
Summerween,Mabel,That sorta takes the fun out of trick-or-treat-or-die.
Summerween,Dipper,I'm trying to take the DIE out of trick-or-treat-or-die.
Summerween,Narration,Trick-or-treaters rings door bell.Lazy Susananswers it.
Summerween,Kids,Trick-or-treat.
Summerween,Lazy Susan,"Well aren't you just the cutest! And is everyone in costume?(Gives the kids candy)Oh, good. Wonderful."
Summerween,Kids,Happy Summerween!
Summerween,"Dipper, Mabel, Candy, Grenda and Soos",Trick-or-treat!
Summerween,Lazy Susan,"And is everybody in costume?(Looks at Grenda)Chimney sweep,(looks at Soos)elephant man,(looks at Candy)squeegee,(looks at Mabel)ant farm!(Looks at Dipper)Oh and what are you supposed to be?"
Summerween,Dipper,"Uh, actually, I'm not dressed up as anything. We're, we're kinda in a hurry, here."
Summerween,Lazy Susan,Oh. I see.(Gives everyone except Dipper one piece of candy)Enjoy!
Summerween,Grenda,One piece of black licorice?
Summerween,Candy,Circus peanut! This is loser candy.
Summerween,Dipper,Four pieces of candy?! This is gonna take forever!
Summerween,Mabel,"We've gotta up our game, Dipper. You gotta put on your costume."
Summerween,Dipper,"I told you, I'm not up to it, Mabel!(Fake coughs)"
Summerween,Trickster,"Oh, really?(Climbs down onto Soos, picks up a piece of candy out of Soos' bag)I've seen better.(Grabs a jack-o-melon)Tick tock.(Blows candle out and jumps behind a house)"
Summerween,Mabel,So what was that about being too sick to wear a costume?
Summerween,Narration,Dipper sighs and kicks a rock. Cut to the Mystery Shack.
Summerween,Soldier and Mummy Kids,We want candy! We want candy!
Summerween,Stan,"(Opens door wearing normal clothes)Alright, you got me, kids. You guys win. I guess I'm not that scary, you know, you've-you've- Oh! No! Ughh!(Screams as Waddles comes out of his shirt)Why?! Why is there a pig jumping out of my chest?!"
Summerween,Narration,Kids look at each other.
Summerween,Mummy Kid,Candy.
Summerween,Soldier Kid,Can-dy!
Summerween,Narration,"Stan stands there, Waddles falls out of his shirt onto the porch and walks away"
Summerween,Stan,What scares you two freaks?
Summerween,Soldier Kid,"(Grins at each Mummy Kid)Here, watch this.(Holds up a smart phone with a video)"
Summerween,Stan,"(Watching video)What, what is this? Some kinda- some kinda kitten or-(monster face appears on the video screaming)Ahhhh!! Ah! Ah!(Runs inside, kids laughing. Stan looks at the mirror.)What happened to you, Stan Pines? What happened?"
Summerween,Narration,Cut to Mabel.
Summerween,Mabel,"Introducing, for the first time in public...(Dipper walks out in his costume, a jar of peanut butter)TADAH! Peanut Butter and Jelly!"
Summerween,"Soos, Candy and Grenda",Awwwww!
Summerween,Candy,(Takes out her phone)I will make you internet famous.(Takes picture)
Summerween,Dipper,"Hey! Erase that! Let's just get this over with, okay?"
Summerween,All,Over with! Over with!
Summerween,Dipper,(Rings doorbell)Do you really think this will make a difference?
Summerween,Biker,"(Opens the door, grunting)"
Summerween,Dipper and Mabel,"(Start dancing)Hat a ta tah, Tah tah ta... TWIIIIINS!"
Summerween,Narration,Biker tears up and dumps the entire candy bowl in their bag. Mabel and Dipper smile. Montage of trick-or-treating plays.
Summerween,Dipper,"Let's get that candy, guys!"
Summerween,Mabel,"(Counting candy)34, 35..."
Summerween,Candy,(Climbs into the wheelbarrow)36. You see? Because —
Summerween,Mabel,"Yeah, I get it.(More trick-or-treating)22, 23, 24. A hundred and twenty-four!"
Summerween,Narration,People start blowing out jack-o-melons.
Summerween,Dipper,"C'mon, c'mon!"
Summerween,Narration,More doorbell ringing.
Summerween,Toby Determined,Hello.
Summerween,All except Toby,(Scream)
Summerween,Mabel,What a horrible mask!
Summerween,Toby,That's just my face.Thisis a mask.(Puts on monster mask)Roar!
Summerween,All except Toby,"Oh, yeah. That's actually better."
Summerween,Toby,(Sighs)
Summerween,Narration,More doorbell ringing.
Summerween,Mabel,"498, 499. We did it!(Group cheers)All we need is one more piece of candy."
Summerween,Dipper,And it's only 8:30. Perfect timing!
Summerween,Mabel,(Hugs Dipper)Mwah! And your cough went away too!
Summerween,Soos,"Dude, I'm gonna go around and grab the truck. Soos, away!(Runs off)"
Summerween,Mabel,Last one to the last house is a pair of wax lips!(Mabel and Candy giggle and run off)
Summerween,Grenda,Not me! Nooo!(Runs after them)
Summerween,Dipper,"(To himself:)The perfect time to go to Wendy's party, and no one needs to know I was trick-or-treating."
Summerween,Narration,Robbie's van pulls up. Dipper panics and quickly takes his costume off and hides it and the wheelbarrow full of candy in the bushes.
Summerween,Wendy,Hey Dipper!
Summerween,Dipper,"Oh hey, Wendy. What's up?(Nudges part of his costume into the bush)"
Summerween,Wendy,Are you comin' to the party?
Summerween,Robbie,What are you doing out here?
Summerween,Dipper,"Oh, um. Haha, I'm on my way. I like watching the trick-or-treaters. Reminds me of when I was a kid.(Wipes nose)"
Summerween,Wendy,"Ok, then. You're coming, right?"
Summerween,Dipper,"Definitely, definitely."
Summerween,Wendy,Cool. See you there.(Van speeds off)
Summerween,Dipper,"Later, guys."
Summerween,Mabel,(Behind him)You're going to a party?
Summerween,Dipper,"Well, hey, I —"
Summerween,Mabel,"(Throws the last piece of candy at him)That's why you were acting so weird and trying to hurry us! You're not sick at all! So if it wasn't for this crazy monster, you were gonna ditch me! On our favorite holiday!"
Summerween,Candy and Grenda,Ooohh.
Summerween,Mabel,What happened to the Dipper who used to love Halloween?!(Looks around)And where's all the candy?!
Summerween,Dipper,"Relax, relax. I left it right here. Behind this bush.(Pushes the bush aside and looks over)Oh no."
Summerween,Narration,The wheelbarrow full of candy has fallen into a creek gorge and most of the candy is floating downstream.
Summerween,Mabel,What did you do!?
Summerween,Dipper,"Well, I-pch I-!"
Summerween,Grenda,"Uh, guys?(As a jack-o-melon goes out)"
Summerween,Mabel,(As jack-o-melons in front of all the houses go out)Oh no! All the jack-o-melons are out!
Summerween,Dipper,Look!(Points down the road where the last jack-o-melon is still lit)
Summerween,Old Man McGucket,(About to blow it out)Ehehe! Good night!(Inhales)
Summerween,All except McGucket,(Gasps)
Summerween,Mabel,Stop!
Summerween,Old Man McGucket,What?
Summerween,All except McGucket,Nonononnonoo. Don't don't don't!
Summerween,Old Man McGucket,Eh? What's happening?
Summerween,Dipper,Just don't blow out that candle!
Summerween,Old Man McGucket,(Pulls out a horn to his ear)What?
Summerween,Dipper,Don't blow out that candle!
Summerween,Old Man McGucket,(Beat)I'm Old Man McGucket!(Inhales)
Summerween,Dipper,Wait!
Summerween,Grenda,(Rams into McGucket and grabs Jack-o-melon)Sorry.
Summerween,McGucket,Eh. Eh. Eh. Eh.(Climbs over a pile of cars)
Summerween,Dipper,"Phew, that was close.(Group sighs; candle goes out)"
Summerween,Mabel,Uh oh.
Summerween,Trickster,(Walks up)Knock knock.
Summerween,Narration,"Grenda drops the jack-o-melon, commercial break."
Summerween,Trickster,So children. Where's my candy?
Summerween,Dipper,"I swear, we had all 500 pieces. Look, it's down there somewhere. We can still get it.(Group nods)"
Summerween,Trickster,I'm afraid it's too late! That was your last chance.
Summerween,Dipper,"(Throws candy at Trickster, but he absorbs it)Go, go, go, go!"
Summerween,Narration,"Group runs around Trickster, who follows them. Candy screams as it grabs her. Mabel trips and is grabbed by the Trickster."
Summerween,Mabel,Ahhh!! Dipper!!!
Summerween,Dipper,Mabel!(Is grabbed by Trickster)
Summerween,Soos,"(Crashes into the Trickster with his truck, causing it to explode; the kids go flying)"
Summerween,Grenda,We're alive! Yeah!
Summerween,Soos,(Stops truck)Woah.
Summerween,Dipper and Mabel,Soos!
Summerween,Soos,"That wasn't like, a regular pedestrian, was it?"
Summerween,Mabel,It was the monster!
Summerween,Dipper,"Thanks, Soos. Phew. I'm just glad it's over, right?(Mabel glares at him and walks away, clearly angry with Dipper for not wanting to trick-or-treat with her)"
Summerween,Soos,(Once everyone is in the car)Did everyone remember to put on their seatbelts?
Summerween,Everyone except Mabel,Yes.
Summerween,Mabel,(Nods)
Summerween,Soos,Let's go!(Truck drives off)
Summerween,Mabel,(Rubs her bruised elbow)
Summerween,Dipper,"Hey, are you okay?(Mabel turns her head away, continuing to give him the cold shoulder)There's probably some bandages back at the Shack."
Summerween,Mabel,"(Looking outside)Uh, guys?(Trickster reforms and growls, jumping onto the back of the truck; group screams and the truck swerves; the Trickster falls off and hits a telephone pole)"
Summerween,Dipper,(Pulling on Soos' cape)Brakes! Brakes! Brakes!(Truck crashes into the Summerween Superstore)
Summerween,Mabel,(Coughs and gasps after she sees the monster)
Summerween,Dipper,We have to hide!(Group runs off)
Summerween,Trickster,(Growls and tears off the truck's door)
Summerween,Dipper,"(He, Mabel, Candy and Grenda are hiding in the shelves)It's blocking the only exit. Everyone, stay quiet!"
Summerween,Mabel,"Oh,nowyou're worried about the monster. I thought all you cared about was Wendy."
Summerween,Dipper,"Mabel, you know that's not true. I just... I felt like I was getting a little too old to go trick-or-treating."
Summerween,Mabel,"That's exactly why we need to go trick-or-treating, Dipper! We're getting older, there's not that many Halloweens left!(sighs sadly)I guess I didn't realize it was already our last one..."
Summerween,Trickster,(Roars)
Summerween,Candy,We have to escape.
Summerween,Grenda,What if it sees us?
Summerween,Soos,"(Hiding in the costume rack)If only there was something we could use to cover our bodies and faces with. You know, like a disguise of some kind."
Summerween,Narration,Dipper and Mabel look at each other. Cut to the shelves where the group is hiding from the trickster in costumes. They are heading towards the exit.
Summerween,Dipper,This way! Almost there!(Turns around)Soos!
Summerween,Soos,(Standing in front of the cackling heads)
Summerween,Dipper,Stop!
Summerween,Mabel,"Soos, don't you dare!"
Summerween,Soos,"Sorry dude, today's been way too stressful. I need some levity.(Presses the skull, nothing happens)"
Summerween,Mabel,"Oh thank goodness. It was out of batteries.(Turns around)Soos, no!"
Summerween,Soos,(Struggling to open a package ofBat-eries. He puts them in and presses the head)
Summerween,Skull,"No matter the score, I'm always a-head! Nyaha nyaha."
Summerween,Soos,Hahaha!(Slaps his leg)This cackling head's the voice of a generation!(Trickster comes up behind him and opens its mouth; Soos presses the head again; the monster eats Soos)
Summerween,Dipper,Hey monster!(Group pulls out toy weapons and starts attacking the Trickster)
Summerween,Grenda,(Chops off one of the Trickster's arm)Salt water taffy? Gross!
Summerween,Dipper,"(Hacks at a leg)What are you—?(Tastes a piece)Wait, it is."
Summerween,Trickster,You really haven't figured it out yet?(Picks the kids up)Don't you recognize me? Look at my face! Look closely.(Pulls the mask off)
Summerween,Dipper and Mabel,(Scream)
Summerween,Mabel,Loser candy!
Summerween,Trickster,"That's right! Did you ever stop and think about the candy at the bottom of the bag that no one likes? Every year the children of Gravity Falls throw away all of the 'REJECTED' candy into the dump. So I seek revenge; revenge on the picky children who cast me aside. I'm made of every tossed piece of black licorice, every discarded bar of old chocolate with like that white, powder stuff on it. You know that stuff!"
Summerween,Mabel,I hate that stuff!
Summerween,Trickster,"No one would eat me. But now, I'm going to eat you.(Hears something)What is that?(Screams)"
Summerween,Soos,"(Rips through Trickster's chest, screaming)'Sup, bro?"
Summerween,Narration,Trickster falls to the ground vomiting jelly beans.
Summerween,Soos,"(Eating the Trickster)Dudes, you want some of this?"
Summerween,"Dipper, Mabel, Candy, and Grenda",(Shake their heads)
Summerween,Trickster,"Wait, you actually think I taste good?"
Summerween,Soos,"Uh, sure! You know."
Summerween,Trickster,All I've ever wanted is for someone to say that I was... good.(Cries candy corn)I'm so happy!
Summerween,Soos,"Crying makes it a little weird, but,(takes another bite)guess I'm still eating."
Summerween,Gorny,(Breaks through Trickster's chest)
Summerween,Soos,"'Sup, Gorny?"
Summerween,Gorny,I've been twaumatized!
Summerween,Narration,Cut to the Mystery Shack.
Summerween,Mummy kid,Now what?
Summerween,Soldier kid,Let's just get our candy already!(Goes inside)Old dude? Old dude?(Goes up to bathroom)
Summerween,Stan,"(Turns the water on, sighs)Wash off the shame, Stan. Wash off the shame."
Summerween,Soldier kid,(Comes into the bathroom)Ha! He thought he could scare us.
Summerween,Narration,The kids watch Stan pulling off the towel.
Summerween,Stan,Eh? What's that?
Summerween,Kids,AAAAAAAA!(Run away)
Summerween,Stan,(Still wearing his underwear)Ahahaha! Still got it!
Summerween,"Dipper, Mabel, Soos, Candy, and Grenda",(Come inside)
Summerween,Dipper,"Hey, Stan!"
Summerween,Mabel,"Hi, Grunkle Stan!"
Summerween,"Soos, Candy, and Grenda","Hello, Mr. Pines!"
Summerween,Stan,How's it hangin'.
Summerween,Wendy,Hey Dipper.
Summerween,Dipper,Wendy!
Summerween,Wendy,I didn't see you at the party. Where were you?
Summerween,Dipper,Uh.. I-uh.. I was trick-o-treating. With my sister.(Puts his arm around Mabel's shoulder)
Summerween,Mabel,Yeah.
Summerween,Wendy,The party was lame anyway. Robbie ate a lollipop stick-first and had to go home sick.
Summerween,Dipper,(Tries not to laugh)
Summerween,Mabel,"Aw, man. We went to every single house, and we didn't even get to eat any candy!"
Summerween,Stan,Candy? How's that for candy?(Holds up the kid's bags)
Summerween,Narration,Dipper and Mabel grin at each other. Cut to the TV.
Summerween,Announcer,And now back to the fear guy from Terror Town Street.
Summerween,Woman,"(On TV, screams at alien)"
Summerween,Alien,(On TV:)NYNG NYNG NYNG.
Summerween,Narration,"Everyone is watching TV, eating the candies. Dipper comes to Mabel and attaches a bandage on Mabel's sore arm. Waddles munches the candy in his bowl."
Summerween,Stan,"You know, kids? I've been thinkin'. At the end of the day, Summerween isn't about candy or costumes. Or even scaring people. It's a day when the whole family can get together at one place and celebrate what really matters: PURE EVIL! HAHAHAHAHA!"
Summerween,Narration,(Everyone laughs maniacally and then stops abruptly. There is a pause.)
Summerween,Soos,I ate a man alive tonight.
Summerween,Narration,Everyone stares at Soos.
Summerween,Narration,"Ending credit. Mabel, Grenda and Candy are taking pictures of Waddles with his business man outfit. Then the song ""9 to 5"" plays, as the screen shows some meme styled pictures of Waddles. Ends with the cracking skull's voice."
Boss Mabel,Narration,"The episode opens withDipper,Mabel,Stan, andWaddleswatchingCash Wheel. Mabel and Waddles are eatingChipackerz."
Boss Mabel,TV Announcer,"Ladies and gentlemen, we now return to Cash Wheel! Sponsored by Chipackerz, the chip flavored crackers!"
Boss Mabel,Mabel Pines,But they taste just like chips!(Eats cracker)
Boss Mabel,Narration,"Contestant spins the wheel and lands on ""cash shower""."
Boss Mabel,Rich,Congratulations! You're taking a...
Boss Mabel,Stan Pines & TV Announcer,Cash shower!
Boss Mabel,Narration,"Money starts falling down on the man in the middle. When the other two contestants try to take some money, he slaps and punches them away."
Boss Mabel,Stan,I like that guy's style.
Boss Mabel,Soos Ramirez,Mr. Pines! We gottouristsat 9 o'clock! A whole busload of 'em!
Boss Mabel,Narration,A bus pulls up and tourists start to get out.
Boss Mabel,Stan,"Hot tamales, it's a jackpot! Soos! Make some new attractions!"
Boss Mabel,Soos,"You got it, boss!(Glues a wolf head onto a chicken)"
Boss Mabel,Stan,Wendy! Mark up those prices! The higher the better!
Boss Mabel,Wendy Corduroy,"(Sighs and puts a 0 behind a $2 price tag, making it $20)"
Boss Mabel,Stan,Higher! Bleed 'em dry!
Boss Mabel,Wendy,"(Puts another 0, making it $200)"
Boss Mabel,Dipper,"Eesh, Grunkle Stan. It's like when you look at tourists, all you see are wallets with legs."
Boss Mabel,Stan,That's not true.(Looks out the window and sees a family as wallets with legs)
Boss Mabel,Wallet Boy,"Thanks for taking me to theMystery Shack, daddy!"
Boss Mabel,Wallet Dad,Ha ha! Now don't spend yourself all in one place.
Boss Mabel,Narration,Another wallet man comes out of a car.
Boss Mabel,Wallet Man,I'm feeling carsick...(groans)Blaaaaaaaah!(Vomits pennies)
Boss Mabel,Stan,(Rubs eyes and sees what the manactuallyvomited; to Dipper)Clean-up on the front lawn!
Boss Mabel,Dipper,"(Sighs, picks up a bucket of water and a mop and heads outside)"
Boss Mabel,Narration,"Cuts totheme song. A boy puts a penny inside a penny press. A small card that says ""Thanks for the penny! -Stan"" comes out. The boy sighs. Cuts to Stan leading a tour around the Mystery Shack."
Boss Mabel,Stan,"Ladies and gentle-tourists! Looking around my Mystery Shack, you will see many wondrous roadside attractions. Be amazed at the only known photo of a horse riding another horse!(Points to a picture of a horse riding another horse, and many tourists take pictures and mutter, interested)That's– That's pretty good!(Tourists take pictures)Be astounded by the horrible, pre-teen wolf boy!(Pulls a curtain revealing Dipper with hair glued to his legs and fake wolf ears and teeth)Oh! Oh, look at him! All that hair! His body's changing, ah!"
Boss Mabel,Dipper,"(Takes out his fake wolf teeth)Grunkle Stan, this is demeaning."
Boss Mabel,Stan,"What? I don't know ""de-meaning"" of that word!(He and the tourists laugh at his joke.)If you throw money at him, he dances."
Boss Mabel,Narration,"The tourists cheer and begin to throw money at Dipper, and he makes an attempt to dance. Stan catches money with a jar."
Boss Mabel,Stan,Ha ha ha! Ooh! Thank you!
Boss Mabel,Narration,Cut to Mabel selling bumper stickers in the gift shop.
Boss Mabel,Mabel,"Behold! Mystery Shack bumper stickers! You can stick 'em on your bumper, or over your husband's mouth. Am I right, ladies? She knows what I'm talking about!"
Boss Mabel,Woman,Oh! You are bad! How much?
Boss Mabel,Mabel,"Hey, it's on the house. That's the Mabel difference! Thanks for visiting!"
Boss Mabel,Stan,What?!(Appears behind a cardboard cutout of himself)What the heck do you think you're doing?
Boss Mabel,Mabel,Business! Ching ching ching!(Presses buttons on the cash register)
Boss Mabel,Stan,"Listen, kid. You don't make money by giving stuff away. You're off of register duty!"
Boss Mabel,Mabel,"But, but-"
Boss Mabel,Stan,No buts except yours out the door. Now shut your yap and get to work!
Boss Mabel,Mabel,"Grunkle Stan, whatever happened to ""please"" and ""thank you""? Hmm? Oh wait. Here they are!(Takes out a bag of stickers and puts two stickers that say ""Please"" and ""Thank you"" on Stan's face)Wop wop!(Chuckles)"
Boss Mabel,Stan,"Ugh. ""Please"" never made me any money, kid. (Puts the ""Please"" sticker on the back of the cash register) In fact, just saying the word is giving me a burning sensation."
Boss Mabel,Narration,"Stan slaps the ""Thank you"" sticker on Soos' back as he sweeps by. Soon after that, Dipper comes in."
Boss Mabel,Dipper,"Grunkle Stan, why do I have to wear this wolf costume? I think I'm getting hookworm."
Boss Mabel,Stan,(Laughs)Yep. Gluing dog hair to your body will do that.
Boss Mabel,Dipper,"You've got all these dumb, fake exhibits in the Shack. Meanwhile, I've seen actual, amazing things in the forest every day! What if you hunted down a real attraction instead of lying to people for a living?"
Boss Mabel,Mabel,"And you should be nicer to your employees, too!"
Boss Mabel,Dipper,Yeah!(High fives Mabel)
Boss Mabel,Stan,"(Sighs)Look, you guys got a problem with how I run the Shack, take it up with the complaints department.(Holds up a trash can.)Zing!"
Boss Mabel,Mabel,"I am going to write them such a letter!(Starts writing a letter, covering what she's writing with her arm.)"
Boss Mabel,Narration,"Cuts to Mabel, Dipper, Wendy, and Soos painting the Mystery Shack sign a glittery pink."
Boss Mabel,Stan,And don't stop till you've covered that sign with glitter! Glittery signs attract tourists! Also large birds.
Boss Mabel,Narration,A bald eagle attacks Soos and he tries to run away from it.
Boss Mabel,Stan,Ha ha! That's funny.
Boss Mabel,Dipper,"Okay, is it just me, or is having Grunkle Stan as a boss seriously the worst?"
Boss Mabel,Wendy,"I know, right? Why do we even put up with it?"
Boss Mabel,Soos,"I tried to give him a suggestion to improve the Shack once. I had this idea where I could be, like, the Mystery Shack mascot: Questiony the Question Mark. I ask people questions, you know. Do the question dance."
Boss Mabel,Mabel,That sounds amazing!
Boss Mabel,Wendy,"Oh, cool!"
Boss Mabel,Dipper,"Yeah, totally!"
Boss Mabel,Soos,"Yeah, well... Stan said I couldn't handle it."
Boss Mabel,Mabel,He said what?!
Boss Mabel,Narration,Cut to Stan saying goodbye to the tourists outside of the Shack.
Boss Mabel,Stan,"And remember, folks! We put the ""fun"" in ""no refunds!""(Walking back into the Shack)Ha ha. Suckers."
Boss Mabel,Mabel,You!
Boss Mabel,Stan,Ah!
Boss Mabel,Mabel,"Grunkle Stan, you've gone too far this time!(Following him into his office)Did you seriously tell Soos not to follow his hopes and dreams because he ""couldn't handle it""?"
Boss Mabel,Stan,"Look, kid, let me break it down for you. Being a boss is about commanding respect. If you give people everything they ask for, they'll walk all over ya."
Boss Mabel,Mabel,No way! I bet you'd makewaymore money being nice than being a big grumpy grump to everyone all the time.
Boss Mabel,Stan,Ha! You think you know more about business than I do? You think you could wear this hat?
Boss Mabel,Mabel,Yeah! 'Cause I give people respect! And glittery stickers!(Stamps a pink star sticker on her left cheek)
Boss Mabel,Stan,"Ha! I'd make more money on vacation than you would, running this place!"
Boss Mabel,Mabel,Then why don't yougoon vacation?
Boss Mabel,Stan,"Interesting... All right, I'm a wagering man. Three days. 72 hours.(Sets an alarm for 72 hours)You run the Shack, and I'll go on vacation. If you make more money than me, I guess it means you're right about the way I run my business. BUT if you lose, uh, you...(writes ""LOSER"" in marker on a white T-shirt)You gotta wear this ""LOSER"" shirt all summer!"
Boss Mabel,Mabel,"Fine. But if I win, I get to be the boss for the rest of the summer! Plus, you have to sing an apologizing song with lyrics by me! Mabel."
Boss Mabel,Stan,"Whoa ho! You got yourself a deal, missy!"
Boss Mabel,Mabel,"No, you gotyourselfa deal!"
Boss Mabel,Stan,Deal!
Boss Mabel,Mabel,Deal!
Boss Mabel,Stan,(Slams his fist on the desk)Deal!
Boss Mabel,Mabel,(Slams her fist on the desk)Deal!
Boss Mabel,Mabel,(Stamps a pink heart sticker on Stan's nose)Deal...
Boss Mabel,Narration,Cut to Stan loading things onto the trunk of theStanmobile.
Boss Mabel,Stan,"See you in 72 hours! We'll see who makes more money.(Throws his fez on Mabel's head and drives away, laughing.)"
Boss Mabel,Dipper,"(Comes out)Mabel, did you just make a bet with a professional con man?"
Boss Mabel,Mabel,"Oh, come on. Being a better boss than Stan will be a cinch. Profit, here we come!(Holds up a jar, then drops it and it breaks)"
Boss Mabel,Dipper,You broke the jar.
Boss Mabel,Mabel,(Interrupting:)We'll get a new one.
Boss Mabel,Dipper,"I guess I shouldn't be too worried. I mean, how much money could Stan even make on vacation?"
Boss Mabel,Narration,Cuts to a man writing on a clipboard.
Boss Mabel,Man,"Can I help you, sir?"
Boss Mabel,Stan,I'm here to take all the cash from your wheel. (Camera zooms out showing that Stan is at Cash Wheel)
Boss Mabel,Narration,"Cuts to Soos, Dipper, and Wendy coming into Stan's office."
Boss Mabel,Soos,"You wanted to see us, Mr. Pines?"
Boss Mabel,Mabel,(Turns around in chair and scoots toward them)Stan is no longer with us.
Boss Mabel,Soos,He's dead? No! It should have been me!
Boss Mabel,Mabel,"Whoa, Soos! Stan's not dead! He's on vacation for three days. We made a bet."
Boss Mabel,Soos,Thank you for that clarification.
Boss Mabel,Mabel,Mabel's in charge now!
Boss Mabel,Dipper,Are those... shoulder pads?
Boss Mabel,Mabel,Uh huuuuuuh! (shakes shoulder pads up and down) It's just one of the many up-to-date managerial tricks I learned from this book I found propping up the kitchen table.
Boss Mabel,Narration,"(Holds upSucceeding In Management 1983; Drinks out of a mug that says ""#2 boss"")"
Boss Mabel,Dipper,"Why does your mug say ""#2""?"
Boss Mabel,Mabel,Because the real #1... is you!(holds a mirror up to them)
Boss Mabel,"Dipper, Soos and Wendy","(laugh, pleased)"
Boss Mabel,Soos,Morale!
Boss Mabel,Mabel,"Walk with me. With me as boss, you're gonna notice a few changes around here. My job is to help you be your best ""S.E.L.V.E.S."": Satisfied, Everyday, Loving Life, Very Much, Everyday, Satisfied. Great listening ears so far!(Stamps a thumbs up sticker on each of them)Waddles, hold my calls!"
Boss Mabel,Narration,"Waddles grabs the phone with his mouth. Mabel, Dipper, Wendy and Soos arrive at the gift shop, and Mabel pulls up a chair."
Boss Mabel,Mabel,"Alright, people, now rap with me. Wendy, how can I make your work space more Wendy-friendly?"
Boss Mabel,Wendy,"Hmm, well, Stan never lets me hang out with friends at work."
Boss Mabel,Mabel,"Stan ain't here, sister! Door's open!"
Boss Mabel,Wendy,Sweet!
Boss Mabel,Mabel,"And Soos, I believe this is yours.(Pulls out a Questiony the Question Mark costume from a cabinet)"
Boss Mabel,Soos,Questiony the Question Mark?! I wish this was an exclamation point to show how excited I am!
Boss Mabel,Mabel,"As for you Dipper...(Holds up Dipper's wolf costume and tosses it in a shredder)Die, wolf costume, die! I want you to head into those woods, and don't come back until you've found an amazing attraction!"
Boss Mabel,Dipper,"Finally! Time to show Stan how a REAL mystery hunter does it!(Runs off, grabs a flail and opens the window)Dipper out!(The flail's weight causes him to fall of the window)"
Boss Mabel,Mabel,"Okay, guys! It's time to prove that nice bosses finish first. In the next forty-eight hours, we're gonna fill up this jar with six hundred billion dollars!(Draws a line on the jar.)"
Boss Mabel,Soos and Mabel,Yeah!(They high five.)
Boss Mabel,Wendy,Wait. Do you know how money works?
Boss Mabel,Mabel,"Of course. Waddles, run down to the shop and grab me a latte.(Gives Waddles a bill and he eats it)Whoa!(gives him another bill and he eats it again)He's a hungry little guy."
Boss Mabel,Narration,Cuts to Stan in a line for an audition for Cash Wheel.
Boss Mabel,Stan,Ugh! This line is taking forever! Time to use my old man powers...AH! I'm having a heart attack! And the only cure is to be a contestant on... on Cash Wheel! Aaugh! Someone give me a part! I'm old!
Boss Mabel,Narration,Several people go over to Stan and try to call people to help.
Boss Mabel,Clipboard Man,Should we escort him off the lot?
Boss Mabel,Cash Wheel Man,"That man is a self-centered attention hog, with no regard for human decency.(Pause)Get him on TV!"
Boss Mabel,Singer,"(Over a montage of Mabel giving herself a thumbs up in the mirror, letting sunlight in the room, drinking a milkshake, looking at a profit graph that is going down and making a smiley face out of it)Whoa, yeah!Come on, girls!Shoulder pads!Make that money!Mabel's the boss now!Walk in, girls!Show them boys!Make that money!Ooooooo, ooooooo, oooo, oooo, ooooo, ooooooooo!"
Boss Mabel,Mabel,"(to Wendy:)Time cards!(to Soos:)Time cards!(to a squirrel, which runs away:)Time cards!(spinning around in her chair)Boss boss boss boss boss!(Later, Mabel puts up a poster of an Eagle and underneath it are the words ""Leadership."" However, Mabel has taped a picture of her face on top of the eagle's)It's beautiful..."
Boss Mabel,Narration,Tourists are seen exiting and dropping money into Mabel's jar.
Boss Mabel,Mabel,Thank you! Ha ha! See you soon! Tell 'em Mabel sent you!(Looks happily at the money in the jar)
Boss Mabel,Dipper,"(Comes up with a large moving bag)Mabel! I captured something! This is gonna blow those tourists away! Ha ha!(The creature inside the bag grabs Dipper's arm, and Dipper punches it repeatably, and the creature lets go.)"
Boss Mabel,Mabel,"Marvelous work, valued employee!(gasps)Who's that? Is it Questiony the Question Mark?"
Boss Mabel,Soos,"Uh, I'm starting to have second thoughts about this, Mabel. I keep forgetting my lines. And this costume is more, um...(steps out from behind the porta-potty, showing he only has his foam question mark and underwear on) revealing, than I expected?"
Boss Mabel,Mabel,"Soos, don't give up. Anything is possible when you...(flips through ""Succeeding in Management 1983"")imaginize it!"
Boss Mabel,Soos,But I don't know what that means.
Boss Mabel,Mabel,Ssh.(Puts finger to Soos's lips)Ssshssssshshsshsssh.(rubs finger around Soos's face) Believe in yourself...(walks away)
Boss Mabel,Soos,Bu-but I...! So-so cold...
Boss Mabel,Mabel,(Enters the Mystery Shack)How's my favorite Wendy?
Boss Mabel,Narration,"A can of soda falls on the ground, and Mabel looks up to seeLee,Nate,Tambry,Thompson, and Wendy wrecking the gift shop while kicking around a shrunken head."
Boss Mabel,Wendy,Yeah! Keep it going!
Boss Mabel,Billy,"(Holding up a box)Oh, what's this?(gets hit in the face with the shrunken head and cries)"
Boss Mabel,Billy's Mom,"Billy! Your face, it's ruined!"
Boss Mabel,Mabel,"I'm so sorry. Please, have a refund.(Gives money)"
Boss Mabel,Billy's Mom,(Takes more money out of the jar and leaves with Billy)
Boss Mabel,Mabel,"Wendy, you got a lot of cleaning up to do. Pleeeaaase.(Pokes the ""please"" sticker on the cash register)"
Boss Mabel,Wendy,"Whoa, all this rule stuff's starting to make you sound like Stan."
Boss Mabel,Mabel,"What?! No! I'm nothing like Stan! In fact,(nervously)take the rest of the day off?"
Boss Mabel,Wendy,With full pay?
Boss Mabel,Mabel,"(Nervously)Of course.(Shifts her suit around and laughs nervously, while Wendy gives a ""thumbs up"" and leaves)"
Boss Mabel,Mabel,"Mabel Pines, you are the best boss ever.(Mabel pats herself)"
Boss Mabel,Soos,(To a woman in the background:)I'M QUESTIONY THE QUESTION MARK!
Boss Mabel,Woman,(Screams and sprays him with pepper spray)
Boss Mabel,Soos,"Aw dude, it stings so bad!"
Boss Mabel,Narration,Cuts to Cash Wheel.
Boss Mabel,Rich,"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to CASH WHEEL!"
Boss Mabel,Narration,The cash wheel logo appears on the screen.
Boss Mabel,Rich,"Now, let's meet those contestants."
Boss Mabel,Doug,"(As his name appears on the screen)I'm Doug from Fairfield, California."
Boss Mabel,Donna,(As her name appears on the screen)I'm Donna from-
Boss Mabel,Stan,"I'M STAN, STAN PINES! HA HA!(As his name appears on the screen)Did we- did we already do me? Hello, I'm Stan."
Boss Mabel,Rich,"Ha ha ha, okay. Well, it's gonna be a long night, folks."
Boss Mabel,Cash Wheel Audience,(Laughs)
Boss Mabel,Rich,It's time to solve-
Boss Mabel,Stan,(laughs)
Boss Mabel,Rich,"It's, uh, time to solve that puzzle!Carla!"
Boss Mabel,Carla,"Yes, Rich?"
Boss Mabel,Stan,"Are there any ""s""es?"
Boss Mabel,Rich,"Actually, it's not your turn yet."
Boss Mabel,Narration,"Two ""S""es appear on the first slot and the last slot of the Cash Wheel board."
Boss Mabel,Stan,I'm ready to solve!
Boss Mabel,Rich,"No, the game hasn't started-"
Boss Mabel,Stan,"Is it ""shut your yaps""?"
Boss Mabel,Narration,The answer appears on the board. The audience claps.
Boss Mabel,Rich,Well played.
Boss Mabel,Stan,"(Spins the wheel)Cash shower, cash shower, cash shower!(The wheel lands on ""Cash Shower"")"
Boss Mabel,Rich,Cash shower!
Boss Mabel,Stan,Yes! Doodle do...(Starts to undress)
Boss Mabel,Rich,Mr. Pines? No! You don't need to take your clothes off! Nope!(Goes in front of camera)Go to commercial! Go to commercial!
Boss Mabel,Narration,Cuts to the Mystery Shack.
Boss Mabel,Dipper,"Ladies and gentlemen! My name's Honest Dipper, and unlike my cheating uncle, I have something to show you thatisn'ta hoax! It nearly killed me getting him into that cage, behold, part gremlin, part goblin, theGremloblin!(Takes the cover off the cage)"
Boss Mabel,Gremloblin,(Growling and pulling on the cage bars; Roars more and spits out a human skeleton arm.)
Boss Mabel,Man,"Well, that's fun."
Boss Mabel,Woman,"It's fake, honey. You can see the strings."
Boss Mabel,Dipper,"What?! Those aren't strings, that's body hair!"
Boss Mabel,Woman,"Oh, look at this, dear. The Six-packalope."
Boss Mabel,Man,(Laughs)Wordplay!(Takes a picture)
Boss Mabel,Dipper,"No, everything else here is fake.(Pulls the couple back over to the cage)This is a real paranormal beast. Hey, fun fact about this little guy, if you look into his eyes, you can see your worst nightmare."
Boss Mabel,Man and Woman,(Look into the Gremloblin's eyes; eyes start to glow)
Boss Mabel,Dipper,"Amazing, right? ...I work for tips."
Boss Mabel,Narration,Ambulance comes to take the scarred couple away.
Boss Mabel,Dipper,Thanks again for visiting!(Sighs)
Boss Mabel,Mabel,(helping customers)Thanks for shopping with us!(As kids knock over a stand)I'll get that! Here you go.(Flattens a dollar that someone was trying to put in the vending machine)Sorry. Have a refund.(Takes money from customers and hands all the items to the customer in front)That's the Mabel difference...(Sighs)
Boss Mabel,Dipper,"Well, I just made two people go insane. How about you?"
Boss Mabel,Mabel,"I'm so tired. I gave Wendy the day off, so I had to do her job."
Boss Mabel,Dipper,"Well, maybe you need to start being a little bit tougher around here."
Boss Mabel,Mabel,"No way, that's what Stan would do! I just need to think positive, be friendly, and everything will work out fine."
Boss Mabel,Narration,Gremloblin roars and breaks through the wall. Tourists scream and run out of the shack.
Boss Mabel,Dipper,What? How did he get out of his locked cage?!
Boss Mabel,Mabel,(Looks guilty)Well...
Boss Mabel,Narration,"Flashback to Gremloblin in the cage, looking up at a key Mabel taped on the ceiling for his ""5 min break""."
Boss Mabel,Dipper,YOU GAVE HIM A BREAK?!
Boss Mabel,Mabel,He's an employee... sort of.
Boss Mabel,Dipper,We've got to round him up. Where's Soos?
Boss Mabel,Mabel,"He was stressed out, so I told him to take a soothing nature walk."
Boss Mabel,Soos,(Outside somewhere in the woods)Hello? Civilization?(Thunder booms and a wolf howls)Doggy?
Boss Mabel,Narration,"Cut back to the Shack. Dipper and Mabel see a television playing ""Cash Wheel""."
Boss Mabel,Rich,"Ladies and gentlemen, Stan Pines is poised to become our grand champion! Anything to say to your fans out there?"
Boss Mabel,Stan,"See you tomorrow night, Mabel!(Holds up the ""Loser"" shirt)"
Boss Mabel,Narration,Gremloblin roars and throws a Mayan calendar inches away from where Dipper and Mabel are. Mabel and Dipper run past and hide in the living room. The Gremloblin starts putting stickers on his face.
Boss Mabel,Mabel,What do we do? He's awarding himself stickers that he didn't even earn!
Boss Mabel,Dipper,"(opens3)Uh, got it! When fighting a gremloblin, use water..."
Boss Mabel,Mabel,(Splashes a cup of water in the creature's face and he roars.)
Boss Mabel,Dipper,(Turns page)...only as a last resort as water will make him much much scarier! AH! Who writes sentences like that?!
Boss Mabel,Narration,Gremloblin roars and grows spines. Cuckoo Clock chimes and he breathes fire on it.
Boss Mabel,Dipper,"Don't worry, he's gotta leave eventually!"
Boss Mabel,Narration,(Much later)
Boss Mabel,Singin' Salmon,I'm the singin' salmon spendin' all day jammin'.(Gremloblin presses the button again)I'm the singin' salmon spendin' all day jammin.'(Gremloblin presses the button and the fish repeats it again.)
Boss Mabel,Mabel,"Ughh, why doesn't he just leave?"
Boss Mabel,Gremloblin,(Sniffs the money jar and starts eating the money)
Boss Mabel,Mabel,Our profits!(runs over to the monster)
Boss Mabel,Dipper,"Mabel, wait!"
Boss Mabel,Mabel,"Stop, stop!"
Boss Mabel,Narration,(Gremloblin looks at her and grabs her. Mabel screams)
Boss Mabel,Dipper,Don't look into his evil eye; you'll see your worst nightmare!
Boss Mabel,Mabel,I wishwehad an evil eye to show him!(looks into the Gremloblin's eye)Oh no! Ahh...
Boss Mabel,Dipper,"Wait. Hey, monster! Take a look at this!(Shows the Gremloblin a mirror)"
Boss Mabel,Gremloblin,"(imagines himself looking in a mirror wearing glasses; in the nightmare:)You've become your father.(In real life, screams, breaks through the wall and runs away)"
Boss Mabel,Dipper,"Well, at least he didn't dothatmuch damage."
Boss Mabel,Gremloblin,"(Grows wings and flies away, breaking the totem pole and setting off a car alarm.)"
Boss Mabel,Dipper,Oh boy.
Boss Mabel,Mabel,"Dipper, it's the third day! We've only got seven hours to earn back our profits, or I've got to wear that loser shirt all summer!"
Boss Mabel,Wendy,"(Walks over with Soos)Hey guys! Am I nuts, or does this place look different?"
Boss Mabel,Mabel,"Wendy, Soos! Am I glad to see you. We've got a lot of work to do, but if we hurry, we can still beat Stan!"
Boss Mabel,Wendy,"Uh, yeah. I've got a little headache, so maybe I should like, not work today."
Boss Mabel,Soos,"And I actually just met this pack of wolves, and I think they're gonna like, raise me as one of their own, so I should really be at the den right now."
Boss Mabel,Mabel,But– but...
Boss Mabel,Wendy,"But hey, we'll see ya on Monday."
Boss Mabel,Soos,"(Pointing to popsicles on the ground)Uh, BT dubs, is anyone gonna eat these?"
Boss Mabel,Mabel,"(Twitches angrily, breaking the pen in her hand)ENOUGH!(Everybody gasps)I have HAD IT! I fought a monster to save this business, and this is how you repay me?! I'm gonna get an ulcer from your lollygagging!"
Boss Mabel,Wendy,Lollygagging?
Boss Mabel,Soos,Ulcer? You're acting... different.
Boss Mabel,Mabel,You shut your yaps!(Wendy and Soos gasp again)I've been doing everyone's job while you bums have been bleeding me dry!
Boss Mabel,Wendy,But I-
Boss Mabel,Mabel,No buts except yours on the floor cleaning! Now quit loafing and get to work!
Boss Mabel,Wendy,"Yes, Mabel."
Boss Mabel,Mabel,"That's yes, BOSS!(Slams her hand on the counter and Stan's fez falls and lands on her head. She looks in the mirror and gasps)Dipper, what have I become?"
Boss Mabel,Dipper,"What you had to, Mabel. What you had to."
Boss Mabel,Mabel,"We've got seven hours to turn this around! Let's go, people!(holds up money jar)"
Boss Mabel,Narration,"(Cut to Cash Wheel. The wheel lands on ""Cash Flood"".)"
Boss Mabel,Rich,You landed on Cash Flood!
Boss Mabel,Stan,(Gets covered in money)I'm givin' none of this to charity!
Boss Mabel,Rich,And now you can go home a thousandaire! Or you could risk everything to double your money with the bonus word!
Boss Mabel,Stan,"Rich, I'm a simple man. So I'm gonna take my winnings, pack my bags, and... BET THEM ALL ON THE BONUS WORD! Come on!(people cheer)"
Boss Mabel,Narration,Cut to the Shack. A crane is repairing the totem pole.
Boss Mabel,Mabel,"(Yelling into a megaphone)Time is money, hard hat! You got complaints, file them with the complaint department!(holds up a trash can)Ughh, my back.(tour bus pulls up)Dipper, we've got tourists at 9 o'clock!"
Boss Mabel,Dipper,But what do I show them? Real magic just freaks people out.
Boss Mabel,Mabel,"Figure something out, knucklehead!"
Boss Mabel,Narration,"Cut to Dipper back inside the shack, wearing a tuxedo with an eye patch, giving the tourists a tour."
Boss Mabel,Dipper,"Ladies and gentle-tourists! This shack is filled with wonders, NEVER before seen by human eyes! Behold, the horrible giant question baby!(Directs their attention to Soos dressed in his Questiony the Question Mark outfit)"
Boss Mabel,Soos,Am I a man? Am I a baby? These are legitimate questions.
Boss Mabel,Narration,The tourists gasp.
Boss Mabel,Dipper,"Have your picture taken with it for a buck. Uh, ten bucks.(Adds a zero after the 1)A hundred bucks!(Adds another after the other 0)"
Boss Mabel,Narration,Cut to the tourists leaving happy.
Boss Mabel,Dipper,We put the fun in no refunds!(Goes back into the Shack)How'd we do?
Boss Mabel,Mabel,We filled the whole jar!(Everyone cheers; suddenly cuts to all the money out of the jar and Dipper paying)
Boss Mabel,Dipper,"Minus the money to replace all the furniture. And supplies to fix the shack, that leaves us...(Puts all this into a calculator, which prints out some paper; all that's left in the jar is a single dollar bill)"
Boss Mabel,Mabel,One dollar.
Boss Mabel,Stan,"(Enters with a clock buzzing)Tick-tock! Time's up, kids!"
Boss Mabel,Mabel,"Oh, no!"
Boss Mabel,Stan,(To Dipper)Nice to see you learned how to dress while I was gone.
Boss Mabel,Mabel,How much did you beat us by?
Boss Mabel,Stan,"I won $300,000!(Dipper and Mabel cringe, he does too)And then..."
Boss Mabel,Narration,Flashback to the Cash Wheel.
Boss Mabel,Rich,"For a chance to double your cash or lose it all, what is the six-letter word you use to ask for something politely? For example, ""May I blank have that?"""
Boss Mabel,Stan,"Do I look like an idiot, folks? The word is ""gimmee."" Two E's.(A buzzer sounds)"
Boss Mabel,Rich,"Oooh! You know, because you've gone this far, we're gonna give you one more chance. Let's try again. It's a ""P"" word. Some might even say it's the ""magic word."""
Boss Mabel,Stan,Pabracadabra! Final answer!(Another buzzer sounds)
Boss Mabel,Rich,"I'm sorry, Stan, but the word is..."
Boss Mabel,Narration,Cut back to the present.
Boss Mabel,Mabel,"Please?(points to the ""Please"" sticker on the cash register)"
Boss Mabel,Stan,Apparently that wordcanmake you money.
Boss Mabel,Dipper,"So, wait. If you lost everything, then that means... Mabel! You won!"
Boss Mabel,"Dipper, Mabel, Soos and Wendy",We did it!
Boss Mabel,Soos,Wait. What did we win again?
Boss Mabel,Stan,"Well, according to our bet, I guess Mabel's the new boss?"
Boss Mabel,"Dipper, Mabel, Wendy and Soos",No! No! Don't do that!
Boss Mabel,Stan,Huh? What?
Boss Mabel,Mabel,"Grunkle Stan, I had no idea how hard it was being boss. This place was cuckoo bananas until I started barking orders at people like you.(Hands him his fez)"
Boss Mabel,Stan,"Yeah, well, I got to admit, It's kind of nice to be back, ya know? Okay, okay, that's enough, get offa me! And Soos, Wendy; get to work! Ahem. Please. Uhh! Still hurts."
Boss Mabel,Dipper,"Mabel, didn't your agreement say something about Stan having to do some kind of apology dance if he lost?"
Boss Mabel,Stan,"N-no. No, it didn't."
Boss Mabel,Mabel,"Actually, yeah, I think I have it in my notes here."
Boss Mabel,Stan,No! That never happened!
Boss Mabel,Wendy,Ha ha! I'll get the camera!
Boss Mabel,Stan,"All right, let me just...(Runs away)"
Boss Mabel,Mabel,Grunkle Stan!!
Boss Mabel,Narration,"Cuts to credits. A camera is filming Stan, who is dressed in a sparkly orange suit."
Boss Mabel,Stan,"Uh, look, I'm not gonna..."
Boss Mabel,Mabel,Do it!
Boss Mabel,Stan,"""I'm Stan, and I was wrong,I'm singing theStan Wrong Song,I shouldn't have taken that chance,Now here's my remorseful dance."""
Boss Mabel,Mabel,Do the kicks!(As Stan kicks)Jazzier!
Boss Mabel,Stan,"(His fez falls off; toGompers, who tries to eat it)Hey, gimme that! Ow! My back!"
Boss Mabel,Mabel,(To Waddles)What do you think?
Boss Mabel,Waddles,Oink!
Boss Mabel,Mabel,Take thirty!(Stan whines)
Boss Mabel,Narration,End
Bottomless Pit!,Narration,The episode opens withStan Pinesdriving theMystery Cartand stopping at thebottomless pit.
Bottomless Pit!,Stan Pines,"In this land of ours, there are many great pits. But none more bottomless than the bottomless pit. Which, as you can see here, is bottomless."
Bottomless Pit!,Soos Ramirez,Question. Is it bottomless?
Bottomless Pit!,Stan,"(Sighs)Kids, can one of you try explaining this to Soos?"
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper Pines,"Grunkle Stan, why are we here again?"
Bottomless Pit!,Stan,"To dispose of things that we don't want. So long,Mystery Shacksuggestion cards!(Throws some cards down into the pit)"
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel Pines,"Goodbye, creepy love letters fromLi'l Gideon!(Throws letters and gifts away)Die! Die!"
Bottomless Pit!,Soos,(Takes off his shoes and throws them in the pit)
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,What are you doing?
Bottomless Pit!,Soos,"Throwing stuff, dude. Everyone's doin' it.(Grabs and throws a barbecue grill down the pit)"
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,(Pushing a large chained box toward the pit)
Bottomless Pit!,Stan,"What you got there, Mabel?"
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,"Oh, it's just my personal box of mysterious secrets. Nothing worth wondering about.(Giggles and pushes the box down the pit)Goodbye forever!"
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,"Grunkle Stan, do I really have to be the one to point out that a bottomless pit is, by definition, impossible?"
Bottomless Pit!,Stan,(Shaking cards out of his fez down the pit)Says you!
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,"(Shrugs to Dipper)Well, I guess we'll never know."
Bottomless Pit!,Narration,"Shortly after, a strong gust of wind immediately starts blowing past Soos, Mabel, and Dipper. They see a storm of dark clouds towering above the Shack and darkens the landscape below."
Bottomless Pit!,Soos,Aah! It's some sort of invisible pushing force!
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,Quick! Everyone back to the shack!(Runs toward the house)
Bottomless Pit!,Stan,I'm not done getting rid of these yet!(Tries throwing more cards into the bottomless pit but the wind blows them into his face)

Bottomless Pit!,Stan,(Screams)
Bottomless Pit!,Soos,(Screams)
Bottomless Pit!,Narration,Everyone stops screaming at once as they free-fall in the darkness. Soos starts talking after a short pause.
Bottomless Pit!,Soos,"So, anyone want to scream some more?"
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,Where are we?
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,(Snaps a green glowstick)We're somewhere where it looks like we're nowhere.(Hangs the glowstick on her arm and giggles)
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,We're gonna land on something eventually. Could be any second now!
Bottomless Pit!,Narration,Everyone braces for a landing but nothing happens.
Bottomless Pit!,Stan,"Well... it looks like we're down here for the long haul. Who wants to see some card tricks?(Takes out cards, which fly up and away)Ta-da!"
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,(Clapping)
Bottomless Pit!,Soos,"Hey, maybe we should pass the time by telling stories."
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,I've got a story. It's called the time Grunkle Stan got us all thrown into a bottomless pit where we spent the rest of our NATURAL LIVES!
Bottomless Pit!,Soos,"(Pauses, intrigued)Go on..."
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,"Come on, Dipper, you can do better than that."
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,"Fine.(Takes the glow stick)I'll tell you a story. A story I'd like to call... ""Voice Over.""(Title card appears; Mabel,Wendy, Soos are on the lawn withWaddles.)"
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,Ready?
Bottomless Pit!,"Mabel, Wendy Corduroy, and Soos","Spin the Pig!(Spin Waddles until he stops, pointing at Stan)"
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,Hey! Grunkle Stan. Ever kissed a pig before?
Bottomless Pit!,Stan,I'm not gonna answer that question.(Goes back to readingGravity Falls Gossiper)
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,(Runs up)Guys! I think I just got bit by a snake! I need you to get me to a hospital qui-i-ick!
Bottomless Pit!,Stan,(Laughing hysterically)
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,What? What's so funny?
Bottomless Pit!,Stan,Sorry. It's just hard to focus on what you're saying with that squeaky puberty voice you got there.
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,My what?
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,"It's nothing to be ashamed of, Dipper. Your voice is(Imitating Dipper:)hillaaarrious!"
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,Are you saying my voice cracks? My voice doesn't crack!
Bottomless Pit!,Soos,"Dude, no offense, but it cracks so much we've already made atechno remixout of it.(Plays the tape)"
Bottomless Pit!,Remix,"(Dipper's voice:)Nice to meet youMy name's Dipper Pines, P-P-Pines, Pines, Pines

Bottomless Pit!,"Mabel, Stan, Soos and Wendy",(Laugh)
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,Give me that!(Grabs the cassette player from Soos and leaves)
Bottomless Pit!,"Mabel, Soos and Wendy",Spin the Pig!
Bottomless Pit!,Narration,"Dipper walks along a sidewalk, mildly embittered."
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,(Sighs)Ugh! Even my sigh sounds weird.
Bottomless Pit!,Old Man McGucket,(Pops out of a hole)Hello there!
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,(Screams)
Bottomless Pit!,McGucket,I couldn't help but overhear yer sitchy-ation! Old Man McGucket!(spits on his hand)Part-time inventor!

Bottomless Pit!,Kid,(Cries and runs away)
Bottomless Pit!,McGucket,"You can run, but I'll still be in your nightmares!"
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,This will really fix my voice? Thanks!(Drinks it and leaves)
Bottomless Pit!,McGucket,"Come mornin', you'll sound like a new man! ...If you survive."
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,"(Cut to him waking up in the morning, yawns, with deeper voice:)Good morning, Dipper. I did it! I diiid it! Now I have a neeew voice! Ha ha ha!(Runs to Mabel's bed)Morning Mabel. Who's my favorite Mabel?"
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,(Screams; hits Dipper with a golf club)Who are you?! What have you done with my brother!? Dipper! I'll save you from this body switchingwarlock!
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,"Mabel, it's me. This is my voice now. I sound awesome. Soouund aaawesome."
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,"I know boys' voices change, but this is weird. Weird and bad."
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,"Mabel, this is the best thing that ever happened to me. And just think of the prank calls.(Dials a number)"
Bottomless Pit!,Tats,(Over phone:)Hello?
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,"Hello, this is the President of the United States of America. I am calling to tell you...(makes raspberry noises)"
Bottomless Pit!,Tats,(Over phone:)What? Who is this?!
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,(Hangs up and laughs)Ho-ho-ho! Magnificent!
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,(Turns away from Dipper)Mabel no like.
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,"(Walks up to Soos in the gift shop)How are you diddly-doing, Soos?"
Bottomless Pit!,Soos,(Grabs a broom and hits Dipper)Kill it! Kill it with fire! Everyone flee!
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,"What gives, man? You guys all made fun of my old voice. I thought you'd like the new one."
Bottomless Pit!,Soos,"Well, at least before you sounded like a real person. Now you sound like some kind of weird commercial dude."
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,"I'll find Stan. He'll like my new voice. You'll see! I'll be right back after these messages! Er... I mean... goodbye.(Goes outside and downtown)Grunkle Stan! Grunkle Stan! Where are you, Grunkle Stan?(Walks bySkull Fracture)"
Bottomless Pit!,Tats,Huh? I know that voice anywhere! You're that guy that prank-called me earlier!(Growls viciously at Dipper)
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,"No! No, I'm not. I'm just a 12 year old boy."
Bottomless Pit!,Tats,"You expect me to believe that, you crazy-voiced punk?!"
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,Wait! No!(Screams and runs away)
Bottomless Pit!,Tats,(Walks into a bar)There's a prank caller on the loose! Let's get him!
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,(Everyone in the bar running after him; Jumps into a hole)Escaaape!(Runs to where Old Man McGucket is)McGucket! Your invention was a catastrophe!
Bottomless Pit!,McGucket,That's probably why I live in a dump!(Dances)
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,My own sister didn't recognize me. I scared away crowds.(Sobs)I even sound ridiculous when I cry.
Bottomless Pit!,McGucket,"Well, now. Here's your problem. I gave you the wrong drinky-majig! This one's for voice-over professional. I'm sure I got a better voice in here somewhere.(Digs through car trunk)"
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,Good! Hurry up!
Bottomless Pit!,McGucket,"You got here just in time. Come sundown, you'd have reverted back to your ridiculous old voice."
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,"It was ridiculous, wasn't it?(Plays the tape)"
Bottomless Pit!,Remix,"(Dipper's voice:)D-D-Dipper PinesThat's me!(Mabel's voice:)This remix is dedicated to my brother. Dipper, your voice is one of a kind.(Soos' voice:)Dude, I've never heard anything like it. R-r-remix over!(Soos makes explosion noise)"
Bottomless Pit!,McGucket,You ready for yer new voice? This one should be permanent!(gives Dipper a new potion)
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,"(Looks back and forth between the vial and the tape; holds vial up to his mouth about to drink it, scene cuts to the Shack; in normal voice:)Hey guys."
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,Dipper!
Bottomless Pit!,Soos,"Dude, you're back!"
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,"I guess I realized that even though my voice may not be perfect, it's still mine, and I wouldn't change it for anything. Not even for whatever was in this new vial."
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,"So, what did you do with the rest of that potion?"
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,I dumped it in Stan's coffee.
Bottomless Pit!,Stan,(Walks in; in a female voice:)Any of you kids seen mah girdle? Where mah girdle at?
Bottomless Pit!,"Dipper, Mabel, and Soos",(Laugh)
Bottomless Pit!,Stan,What? What's so funny? I'm Grunkle Stay-an! Kids laughin'. Laughin' at their Grunkle.
Bottomless Pit!,Narration,Cuts back to real time
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,I spy with my little eye something that is... Black!
Bottomless Pit!,Soos,"Ooh, ooh! Everything!"
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,Yay for Soos!(Claps)
Bottomless Pit!,Soos,Yay for Soos!
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,"Hey guys, who wants to pass the time by spinning? Everyone spin!"
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,No.
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,(Spinning Dipper)Wheeee!
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,Woooaah!
Bottomless Pit!,Soos,(Chuckling)
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,(Running on top of Dipper)Wheeee!
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,"Ow, ow, ow, ow."
Bottomless Pit!,Stan,"Dipper's pain is funny, but I'm starting to get bored. Soos, tell a story."
Bottomless Pit!,Soos,"Really? Okay.(Dipper screams as he spins and floats at background)This story is called ""Soos' Really Great Pinball Story""! Is that a good title? Does it have to be a pun or whatever?(Title card appears. Cut to Soos, Dipper, and Mabel in the pinball room. Soos is playing pinball.)"
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper and Mabel,Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Bottomless Pit!,Soos,"This is it, dudes. After four long years of trying, I might finally get a high score on Stan's creepy old pinball machine. If I do this, I'll go down in pinball history, with the likes of Sal, Gaff, and of course, Poo."
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,Have you ever tried maybe tilting the machine?
Bottomless Pit!,Soos,"I don't know, dudes, isn't breaking the rules like, against the rules?"
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,Nuts to the rules! Tilt! Tilt! Tilt!
Bottomless Pit!,Soos,(Loses)
Bottomless Pit!,Pinball Machine,Failure! You stink!
Bottomless Pit!,Soos,"All right, that's it! Are you ready, kids?"
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel and Dipper,(Tilting the machine)Tilt! Tilt! Tilt! Tilt!
Bottomless Pit!,Pinball Machine,"Quit tiltin', partner. Quit tiltin'!"
Bottomless Pit!,Soos,Tilt!(tilts the ball into the goal)
Bottomless Pit!,Pinball Machine,Bulls-eye! New high score!
Bottomless Pit!,"Mabel, Dipper and Soos",(Cheering)
Bottomless Pit!,Soos,This is the best moment of my life. This totally beats my old best moment.(Flashback to Soos pressing the eject button on a VHS player and a piece of pizza comes out. Soos picks up the pizza and prepares to eat it. Cut back to the present.)
Bottomless Pit!,Pinball Machine,That ain't right. You cheated.
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,"Oh, yeah. What are you gonna do about it? You're just a Pinball game, Pinball game. Taunt, taunt."
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,"Uh, guys, there's an awful lot of green lightning coming out of that game."
Bottomless Pit!,Soos,"No, that's the normal amount of green lightning."
Bottomless Pit!,Narration,Lightning strikes them. Cut to Soos wearing cowboy clothes in the pinball game.
Bottomless Pit!,Soos,"(Lying down and hitting a buzzer)Uh, 5 more minutes.(gets up)Ah! That's not a normal alarm clock."
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,(Runs up with Mabel; they are also wearing old west themed clothes)Soos! We're inside the game! Crazy!
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,Sweet Moses!
Bottomless Pit!,Soos,Hushed exclamation of wonder!
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,Awesome!
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,(Jumping around on the buzzers)Boing! Boing! Boing! Boing!
Bottomless Pit!,Soos,"Dude, if this is a dream, I never want to wake up!"
Bottomless Pit!,Pinball Machine,"That can be arranged. Welcome toTumbleweed Terror, partners."
Bottomless Pit!,Soos,"Hey, it's the skeleton cowboy guy. Did you zap me into your game to congratulate me on getting the high score? I beat Poo, dude!"
Bottomless Pit!,Pinball Machine,"Hardly. If'n I do recall, I warned y'all not to cheat. I tried to be gentleman-like, but I'm plum sick of being tilted. So, now I reckon, I'm gonna tilt you."
Bottomless Pit!,Soos,"Well, take this!(Hits a button but hits himself in the eye)Ow! And this!(Punches himself again)Ow! It hurts. I wish this was working better. And this! Aw, dude!(Knocks himself out)"
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel and Dipper,Soos!
Bottomless Pit!,Pinball Machine,(Laughs)Get yourselves ready for the...
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,Multi-Ball!
Bottomless Pit!,Soos,Multi-Ball!
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,Multi-Ball!
Bottomless Pit!,Pinball Machine,Ha ha ha ha ha!
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,Over there!
Bottomless Pit!,Narration,"Dipper, Mabel, and Soos run behind a wall."
Bottomless Pit!,Pinball Machine,Where are you? I'm not done teachin' you a lesson about cheating yet!
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,"How are we gonna get out of here? Think, guys."
Bottomless Pit!,Soos,"I'm trying. But it's hard with that gorgeous pinball wench distracting me.(Waves at a cutout of a woman)Okay. Don't worry, guys, I know every inch of this machine. There's a manual power switch inside. I can sneak in there and turn off the game. But we'll have to distract the cowboy guy. Are either of you good at jumping up and down and making annoying noises?"
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,(Hair blowing in wind)My time has come.
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,"Alright, let's go, Soos. Soos?"
Bottomless Pit!,Soos,"(To the pinball wench:)So are you, like, doing anything later?"
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,(Spins the wench)
Bottomless Pit!,Soos,"Oh, right."
Bottomless Pit!,Pinball Machine,"Come on out and show yourselves, varmints."
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,(Jumps up on a buzzer)Hey! Hey! Hey! Look at me and listen to what I'm doing! BUZZZZZZ! DISTRACTION! DISTRACTION! LA! LA! LA! LA! LA!
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,(Sings)
Bottomless Pit!,Pinball Machine,Something ain't right here. Let me see where this is going.
Bottomless Pit!,Soos,"(Gets in a cart, rolls down behind the pinball machine)"
Bottomless Pit!,Pinball Machine,"Ha ha ha ha. Yippy ti yi what? Where are ya?(Tries to turn)Darn it, I wish I had a neck."
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,"Soos, pssssst. What's going on? Just press the switch already!"
Bottomless Pit!,Soos,"Okay, so I was gonna do that, but I've been thinking. According to this, turning off the power erases the high score permanently. That score is like my one big life accomplishment."
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,"What? If you don't hurry up, we could die in here!"
Bottomless Pit!,Soos,"Fair point. But, what is life anyway when compared to the immortality of a high score?"
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,"Soos, are you out of your--?!"
Bottomless Pit!,Pinball Machine,"There y'all are. Get ready to meet your maker, kids! My maker is Ballway Games in Redmond, Washington.(inhales)"
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper and Mabel,(Being sucked toward the cowboy skull)Woooooaah!
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,Soos!
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,"Soos, please!"
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,Turn it off!
Bottomless Pit!,Soos,"Uhhh Uhh. Goodbye, high score.(Pushes the button and the pinball game turns off. He and the twins wake up outside of the game)Woah! You dudes okay?"
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,Yes! You did it! You freed us!
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,"Hey man, I'm sorry you had to lose your high score."
Bottomless Pit!,Soos,That's okay. I've got a new life accomplishment now. Saving you dudes.
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper and Mabel,Awwwww.
Bottomless Pit!,Soos,You think that pinball wench will call me?
Bottomless Pit!,Narration,Cut back to the present.
Bottomless Pit!,Stan,"I can't believe this nonsense! Magic tonics? Soos winning at something? Where do you come up with this stuff? I'll tell you a good story. It's called ""Grunkle Stan wins the football bowl"".(Cut to a football stadium. Stan makes a touchdown and dances.)"
Bottomless Pit!,Football player,"Mr. Pines! I thought old folks were useless, but you taught me and my gloating friends a lesson."
Bottomless Pit!,Beautiful Woman,"(Arriving on a gigantic trophy)Here's your football winning trophy, Mr. Pines."
Bottomless Pit!,Stan,"Thanks, beautiful woman. But I couldn't have done it without my sidekick,Footbot."
Bottomless Pit!,Footbot,"Thank you for building me, Daddy!"
Bottomless Pit!,Narration,Stan and football players laugh as fireworks go off.
Bottomless Pit!,Footbot,"I love you, Stan."
Bottomless Pit!,Narration,Cut back to the present.
Bottomless Pit!,"Soos, Dipper and Mabel",Boooooo!
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,Come on! Ridiculous!
Bottomless Pit!,Soos,(Simultaneously)I'm incredulous!
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,(Simultaneously)That was really dumb!
Bottomless Pit!,Stan,What? That story was great! I even threw in a talking robot for the kids.
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,"Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna tell a non-terrible story. A story called ""Trooth Ache!""(Title card appears. Dipper, Mabel, and Stan are in the driveway while Manly Dan ties up a bear.)"
Bottomless Pit!,Stan,"This attraction is gonna make me a fortune. Easy with that bear, Corduroy! I need him in showroom condition."
Bottomless Pit!,Bear,(Roars)
Bottomless Pit!,Manly Dan,No! Noo!!(wrestles the bear)
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,Aaaaawww. They're hugging.
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,"So, let me get this straight. Your plan is to teach this bear to ride a bicycle?"
Bottomless Pit!,Stan,"Nah. Come on, everyone's seen a bicycle-riding bear. No, no. I'm gonna teach this bear... to drive!(Cut to Stan's car driving crazily on the road. The bear is driving, Stan is in the passenger seat, and Dipper and Mabel are in the back seat.)And the yellow light means ""speed up"".(Hears cops' siren noise)Uh-oh."
Bottomless Pit!,Blubs and Durland,(stops Stan's car)
Bottomless Pit!,Stan,"What seems to be the problem, officers?(The bear starts gnawing its seatbelt)"
Bottomless Pit!,Sheriff Blubs,Now there'd better be a darn good explanation for this.
Bottomless Pit!,Stan,"Oh, there is. You see, I'm a very old man, not long for this Earth, and the doctor's assigned me a seeing-eye bear to drive me to the hospital in case of emergencies.(Mabel feels suspicious to herself)"
Bottomless Pit!,Sheriff Blubs,Is that right? Then where is your doctor's note?
Bottomless Pit!,Stan,"Why, it's right here, inside my jacket.(writes note inside jacket quickly)There you go.(gives them the note, which says ""Stan is sick and needs a bear. -Dr. Medicine"")"
Bottomless Pit!,Sheriff Blubs,"Well, I can't argue with Dr. Medicine."
Bottomless Pit!,Stan,"To the hospital, Honeypants!"
Bottomless Pit!,Bear,(roars and drives away)
Bottomless Pit!,Narration,"Cuts to later in the Mystery Shack. Stan is spray-painting rocks with gold under a sign titled ""Real Gold Nuggets!"" Mabel walks up to him."
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,"Grunkle Stan, how could you lie to those policemen? Don't you know lying is always wrong?"
Bottomless Pit!,Stan,"Mabel, when you get to be my age, you'll learn that you sometimes have to bend the truth for the greater good.(eats spaghetti)"
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,"(comes in)Hey, have any of you seen my plate of spaghetti?"
Bottomless Pit!,Stan,(hides spaghetti behind him while turning around to Dipper)No... But I bet Soos has. You know how he likes to eat.
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,"This is a dark day. Thanks, Grunkle Stan.(runs off)"
Bottomless Pit!,Stan,See? Greater good.
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,Aaaaah!
Bottomless Pit!,Narration,Cuts to Mabel lying on her bed with Waddles
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,"Waddles, what am I gonna do about Grunkle Stan?(As Waddles:)He needs to stop lying.(Regular voice:)I know, but how do we stop him?(As Waddles:)Maybe you should check Dipper's journal. Oink Oink.(Regular voice:)Say oink one more time.(As Waddles:)Oink Oink.(Regular voice:)Waddles, you genius!(Opens journal; reading aloud:)""Buried 'neath a tree stump in the deep forest aretruth teeth, which force upon the wearer an inability to lie."" Hmmm...(Cut to Stan sleeping at night. Mabel puts truth teeth in his mouth and wakes him up by grabbing his nose)"
Bottomless Pit!,Stan,What? What's going on? Huh? Mabel?
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,Quick question. What happened to Dipper's spaghetti plate?
Bottomless Pit!,Stan,"I ate it because I have little to no concern about other people's possessions or emotions.(Realizes what he just said)Huh, that was strangely candid. Almost as if I'm unable to lie. Well, good night!(Goes to sleep)"
Bottomless Pit!,Narration,Cut to that morning. Mabel is whispering in Dipper's ear.
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,You what? That seems like a horrible idea!
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,It's great! Now he has to tell the truth.
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,Hmmm.
Bottomless Pit!,Stan,"(Gives them plates)Scrambled meat, here it is."
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,"Stan, what do you do in secret every day during your lunch break?"
Bottomless Pit!,Stan,"Usually, I spend the hour aggressively scratching myself in places I shouldn't mention. Now I'm going to avoid making eye contact by pretending to read this newspaper, and go to the bathroom without washing my hands.(Leaves)"
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper and Mabel,Eeeeeeewww!
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,"Well, that was disturbing."
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,"Don't worry, Dipper. The truth is always a good thing.(Cut to Stan in the gift shop)"
Bottomless Pit!,Unnamed man,"(to Stan:)Hey, excuse me. Do you think this t-shirt is my size?"
Bottomless Pit!,Stan,"Never mind the t-shirt! Hey everyone, look at this guy's abnormal and unattractive face!"
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,(leads man away)I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.(Cut to Stan doing taxes)
Bottomless Pit!,Stan,Doing my taxes.
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,"(looks at one of the papers, which has ""I HAVE COMMITTED TAX FRAUD"" on it)Uh, Grunkle Stan, why did you write this?"
Bottomless Pit!,Stan,Because I regularly commit massive tax fraud.
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,You might wanna... tuck that one away there.(inserts paper into a shredder)
Bottomless Pit!,Narration,"Dipper, Mabel and Stan are watching TV, where a man is juggling on a unicycle with three live alligators watching him in the middle."
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper and Mabel,Hahahahaha!
Bottomless Pit!,Stan,"Sometimes, I think: is this all there is? Is life just some kind of horrific joke without a punch line? That we're all just biding our time until the sweet, sweet, release of death?"
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,(Rocks back and forth)
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,(Shivers)
Bottomless Pit!,Narration,Cut to later
Bottomless Pit!,Stan,"(Yelling up to Dipper and Mabel, who are in their room:)Kids! I think I have a growth forming on my back! Just wanted to be honest with you guys!"
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,"I can't take it anymore, Mabel! We need to take those teeth out of his mouth."
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,But then he'll be a liar again!
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,Could it possibly be any worse than this?
Bottomless Pit!,Narration,"The doorbell rings. Dipper and Mabel run downstairs, where Stan is standing in the doorway with Sheriff Blubs and Deputy Durland."
Bottomless Pit!,Sheriff Blubs,"So, after further investigation, turns out thereisno Dr. Medicine in Gravity Falls."
Bottomless Pit!,Deputy Durland,You'd better have a darn good explanation for this!
Bottomless Pit!,Stan,"Oh, and I do. You see, I lied to you. In addition I've been parking in handicapped spaces, shoplifting fireworks, and smuggling endangered animals across multiple state lines. Also, you're fat."
Bottomless Pit!,Sheriff Blubs,(Drops his coffee)Is all of this true?
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,"No! No, it's not true. Right, Mabel?"
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,"Uh, sirs, I have to be completely and totally honest with you. Our Great Uncle Stan is...is...(Stan holds out his hands for the handcuffs, Blubs raises his nightstick)Stan is... secretly a crime fiction writer!"
Bottomless Pit!,Sheriff Blubs,What?
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,"Yeah. He was just telling you about a character in his upcoming page turner, Crime Grandpa! He's never committed a crime in his life. Also, have you lost weight?"
Bottomless Pit!,Sheriff Blubs,Finally! Someone noticed.
Bottomless Pit!,Deputy Durland,"Wow, an author! Can you teach me how to read?"
Bottomless Pit!,Stan,What? Author?
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,"Ha ha, writer, master of fiction. Good night, officers.(Closes the door and sighs)"
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,"Hey, you alright?"
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,I can't believed I lied.
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,"Mabel, it was for the greater good."
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,"Yeah, the greater good."
Bottomless Pit!,Stan,"(On phone:)Hello? Police station? I forgot to tell him about my tax fraud. No, tax fraud."
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper and Mabel,(Tackle him)
Bottomless Pit!,Stan,What's gotten into you kids?
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,"(Pulls out the teeth)We have to find a place to get rid of these!(Cut to Mabel throwing out the box into the bottomless pit at the beginning of the episode. In the present:)And I never saw that box full of magical teeth again.(Sees the box next to Stan)Oh wait, there it is."
Bottomless Pit!,"Soos, Dipper & Stan",(sighs)
Bottomless Pit!,Soos,"Oh, sweet! My shoes!(Puts his shoes back on)"
Bottomless Pit!,Stan,I liked the part with the bear. The rest seemed pretty far-fetched.
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,"Mabel, we already know that story! We just lived through it."
Bottomless Pit!,Soos,"So if we're living through that story right now, then how does it end?"
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,"Guys, do you see that?"
Bottomless Pit!,Narration,They are approaching some light.
Bottomless Pit!,Soos,What is that?
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,Oh no!
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,Where are we going?
Bottomless Pit!,Stan,Not good!
Bottomless Pit!,All,(Scream as they fall out of the pit and onto the spot they fell from)
Bottomless Pit!,Stan,Where... where are we?
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,(gasps)Look! The Shack! Which means... we came right back out the top.
Bottomless Pit!,Dipper,And I don't think any time has passed. It must be some kind of wormhole.
Bottomless Pit!,Soos,"Yeah, dude. That sounds science-y enough to be true."
Bottomless Pit!,Stan,But that's impossible. No one will believe us.
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,Maybe this is one story we should keep to ourselves.
Bottomless Pit!,All,Agreed.
Bottomless Pit!,Stan,"(Leans on the sign, which breaks, and he falls into the hole)"
Bottomless Pit!,Mabel,He'll be fine.
Bottomless Pit!,Narration,Cuts to credits.
Bottomless Pit!,Stan,(Falling in silence down the hole; Sighs)This is stupid.
The Deep End,Narration,"The episode opens on the sky, where the sun is shining, then pans down to a view of the outside of theMystery Shack."
The Deep End,Toby Determined,"(On the radio)Watch out,Gravity Falls, because at 110 degrees, we're looking at the hottest day of the summer!"
The Deep End,Narration,"(A squirrel runs into frame and erupts into flames. Cut to inside the Mystery Shack.Wax Stanmelts, the wallpaper curls and peels off by itself, and water in the fish tank boils due to the heat. Cuts toMabel,Dipper,Stan(holding a chocolate ice cream bucket), andSoosin the living room, having stripped down to their undergarments, not quite enjoying the heat.)"
The Deep End,Dipper Pines,"All in favor of doing nothing all day, say ""ugh."""
The Deep End,"Dipper, Mabel, Stan, and Soos",(All raising their hands)Ugh...
The Deep End,Narration,(Waddleswalks up to Stan's chocolate-covered mouth.)
The Deep End,Stan Pines,I'm gonna throw this pig out of the house!
The Deep End,Narration,"(Waddles oinks and starts licking Stan's cheek, to his dismay.)"
The Deep End,Stan,"You called my bluff, pig."
The Deep End,Toby,"(On the radio)On the bright side, pun very much intended, it's opening week at theGravity Falls Pool."
The Deep End,Mabel Pines,(Suddenly perks up)Gravity Falls Pool?
The Deep End,Dipper,Today?
The Deep End,Soos Ramirez,Pun intended?
The Deep End,Stan,Quick! To thecar!
The Deep End,Narration,"(Stan tries to get up, but is stuck to the floor.)"
The Deep End,Stan,"Hey, kids, a little help here?"
The Deep End,Narration,(Mabel and Dipper pull out spatulas and attempt to release Stan from the floor. Soos shudders)
The Deep End,Stan,Alright! Off to the pool!
The Deep End,Narration,"(Stan turns around, and reveals that the twins removed the wood from the floor when breaking him free. Then he goes off screen.)"
The Deep End,Toby,(On the radio)And remember to be on alert for random wildfires!
The Deep End,Stan,"(Off screen)Wait, what?(He is heard catching on fire)Aaaah!"
The Deep End,Mabel,(To Dipper)He'll be fine.
The Deep End,Narration,(Cuts totheme song. Scene shows an establishing shot of the Gravity Falls pool.)
The Deep End,Mabel,"Ah, the pool! A sparkling oasis of summer enchantment!"
The Deep End,Stan,"Yeah, nothing like sitting in a moist tub with strangers. It's like the bus, but wet."
The Deep End,Dipper,(Looking at the towel Soos is holding)Why would a sun need to wear sunglasses?
The Deep End,Soos,It's best not to think about it.
The Deep End,Mabel,"Whoa, whoa! Stop the presses! Who's that?"
The Deep End,Narration,(Mabel looks at ahandsome young manwhose hair is blowing in the wind)
The Deep End,Soos,"Oh, yeah.(Eats a corn chip)Word is, dude never leaves the pool. People say he's a ""Mysterious loner.""(Backs away from Mabel while eating corn chips)"
The Deep End,Mabel,Is it getting hot out here or is it just that guy?
The Deep End,Dipper,"It's the hottest day of the year, Mabel. Besides, can't you go for one week without having a new crush on some random guy?"
The Deep End,Mabel,Uh-uh.(Gasps)Look at his little mustache hairs!
The Deep End,Soos,You are clearly enamored. Go to him.
The Deep End,Narration,"(Mabel runs across the pool, but trips across a bucket and stumbles on two men in lawn chairs.)"
The Deep End,Man 1,"Hey, come on!"
The Deep End,Man 2,"Watch it, kid!"
The Deep End,Mabel,"(While breaking her leg free from a lawn chair and knocking over a basket of beach balls)Aaah! Oops, sorry."
The Deep End,Soos,It's so beautiful!
The Deep End,Dipper,"Eh, Mabel's all talk. You wanna know a secret? She's never even kissed a guy before. She always messes it up somehow."
The Deep End,Stan,Oi. Women.(A water balloon is thrown in his face)Aaah!
The Deep End,Wendy Corduroy,"(Sits on a lifeguard's chair, wearing a red swimsuit and a whistle)Hey, Mr. Pines!"
The Deep End,Stan,Wendy? Where's the lifeguard?
The Deep End,Wendy,"Iamthe lifeguard. I make the rules, sucka!(Throws a water balloon at Stan)Boosh!"
The Deep End,Stan,Aah!(Runs away from two more water balloons)She's attacking me with water!
The Deep End,Narration,"(Wendy, Soos, and Dipper laugh.)"
The Deep End,Dipper,Wow. You work here?
The Deep End,Wendy,I found out lifeguards get free snack privileges. Plus I get the best seat in the house.
The Deep End,Dipper,"Yeah, you do!(Laughs, then whispers)I've been laughing for too long..."
The Deep End,Soos,"Dude, are you and Wendy having a secret staring contest? 'Cause I think you're winning—"
The Deep End,Dipper,"Soos! Shh!(Pushes Soos away, Wendy looks confused)So, hey, you wanna go chuck more water balloons at Grunkle Stan?"
The Deep End,Wendy,"I'd love to, but I gotta spend the day doing tryouts. We're looking for a new assistant lifeguard."
The Deep End,Dipper,"Hey,(Clears throat; deeper voice)hey.(Normal voice)What if I was assistant lifeguard?"
The Deep End,Wendy,"That would be so much fun! You're totally in, dude!(Throws a rescue can at Dipper; he catches it)You just have to check in with my boss first,Mr. Poolcheck."
The Deep End,Dipper,Your boss?
The Deep End,Narration,(It shows a masculine man doing push ups with his index fingers. He turns in Dipper's direction with an unsettling expression; Dipper gasps.)
The Deep End,Narration,"(Cuts to the boy Mabel was attracted to. He's drinking lemonade. Suddenly, Mabel bursts out of the water.)"
The Deep End,Mabel,"Wow! Oh my gosh, how crazy bumping into you here even though we don't know each other!"
The Deep End,Mermando,How long have you been underwater?
The Deep End,Mabel,"That doesn't matter!(Coughs up a band-aid)So, hey! My name's Mabel."
The Deep End,Mermando,(In Spanish)Hola.
The Deep End,Mabel,Whoa! Are you Australian?
The Deep End,Mermando,(Laughs)I am charmed by your sense of humor. And your bold lack of water-wings!
The Deep End,Mabel,(Laughs)You're so funny! And your hair is beautiful...
The Deep End,Mermando,"No, no, it has silly tangles!"
The Deep End,Mabel,"Mind if I...(Pulls out a comb, and begins to brush Mermando's hair)"
The Deep End,Mermando,"Why, Mabel. You are so forward.(Laughs)"
The Deep End,Mabel,"(Thinking)This is it! He likes you! Go for it, Mabel! It's time! Ask him out on a date!(Speaking)So, hey, you wanna go dry off? Maybe hit the snack bar or—?"
The Deep End,Mermando,I-I'm afraid I cannot! For I have a terrible secret!(Mabel is shocked by his words)I must go.
The Deep End,Narration,"(He swims off, leaving Mabel by herself.)"
The Deep End,Mabel,I'm upset. Yet intrigued!
The Deep End,Narration,"(Cuts to Dipper talking to Mr. Poolcheck while hammering a wooden sign on the pool supplies door reading ""DO NOT TOUCH!!"")"
The Deep End,Dipper,And that is why I think I'd make a good lifeguard assistant.
The Deep End,Mr. Poolcheck,"Hmm...(Gets down and sniffs Dipper)SPF 100? Good, I like you. But this isn't an easy job. It's anarchy out there."
The Deep End,Narration,(Poolcheck points to the pool. It shows the pool being perfectly calm.)
The Deep End,Dipper,I think I can handle it.
The Deep End,Mr. Poolcheck,"Can you handleTHIS?!(He pulls off his right hand, revealing it to be prosthetic; Dipper gasps in shock)I lost my HAND to a pool filter!(Reattaches hand to his wrist)The pool may seem friendly, but she can turn on you in an instant! Which is why you must respect her rules! Do you think you have what it takes, boy?(Grips Dipper aggressively)DO YOU?!!"
The Deep End,Narration,"(Dipper looks at Wendy, who is giving him a thumbs up.)"
The Deep End,Dipper,Sure. I guess.
The Deep End,Narration,(Mr. Poolcheck puts a whistle around Dipper's neck.)
The Deep End,Mr. Poolcheck,"Welcome to the deep end, son."
The Deep End,Dipper,"Well, thanks, I—(Mr. Poolcheck strangles him in a hug.)Yep. Oh, this is happening."
The Deep End,Narration,"(Cut to Stan and Soos walking by the pool to see a single lawn chair, sparkling clean.)"
The Deep End,Stan,"There she is, Soos. Equidistant from the snack bar and the bathroom, just the right amount of sun and shade. And pointed away from whereOld Man McGucketlotions himself."
The Deep End,Old Man McGucket,Whoo-wee!
The Deep End,Disgusted man,"Ah, my eyes!"
The Deep End,Stan,The perfect lawn chair.(The chair shines in the sunlight)
The Deep End,Soos,The legends that you told me in the car were true.
The Deep End,Stan,"I just can't believe it wasn't already taken. And now to sit on it, thereby claiming it as my own."
The Deep End,Narration,"(Stan tosses his ""Property of Stan"" towel on the chair and sits down, but a foot rests on his back just as he does)"
The Deep End,Stan,WHAAAAAAAT?!?!
The Deep End,Gideon Gleeful,"Why, hello, Stanford."
The Deep End,Stan,"(Stands up angrily)GIDEON! GET OUTTA MYCHAIR, KID!!"
The Deep End,Gideon,"Oh my, was this your chair? I had no idea.(Whispers)Yes, I did, Stan. I knew. Mm! Ooh!"
The Deep End,Stan,"Move it, you little troll!"
The Deep End,Gideon,"First come, first serve!(Giggles and rolls around on the chair)"
The Deep End,Stan,I'll first serveYOU!!(He picks up Gideon; suddenly the whistle blows)Huh?
The Deep End,Narration,(Cuts to Stan in pool jail.)
The Deep End,Stan,"Come on, Wendy! You can't do this to an old man!"
The Deep End,Wendy,"Sorry, Stan, it's not up to me.(Chuckles)Actually, it is."
The Deep End,Dipper,"Hey, Wendy, I got the job!"
The Deep End,Wendy,Sweet! Wanna go abuse our power?
The Deep End,Dipper,But what if Poolcheck catches us? He seems emotionally unstable.
The Deep End,Narration,(Cuts to Mr. Poolcheck doing sit-ups on the chain-link fence. He observes his surroundings like an intimidating hawk before lowering himself down again.)
The Deep End,Wendy,"Nah, don't worry, man. You just gotta be sneaky about your rule-breaking. Race you to the no running sign!"
The Deep End,Narration,"(Dipper runs after her, but then sees Poolcheck, who is drinking water from the pool. Mr. Poolcheck looks at him and licks the extra water off his face. Dipper then slows down.)"
The Deep End,Narration,(Cuts back to pool jail.)
The Deep End,Kid 1,How long you in for?
The Deep End,Stan,"Two hours for roughhousing, but I'm innocent!"
The Deep End,Kid 2,Pool jail ain't so bad... as long as you don't wind up in solitary.
The Deep End,Narration,(Cuts to a kid trapped inside a pool vent.)
The Deep End,Pool Jail kid,It's the nights that are the hardest.
The Deep End,Narration,"(Cuts back to Mermando. Mabel comes out of the water, but then drops under again when Mermando looks her direction. Again, Mabel appears, but ducks yet again when Mermando thinks he hears her. Mabel then pops out of the water.)"
The Deep End,Mabel,"Hey there!(Mermando screams)I brought you a sandwich. It's sort of wet, but it's still good. Blop."
The Deep End,Narration,(Mabel puts the sandwich on Mermando's inflatable raft.)
The Deep End,Mabel,"I like sharing things. Sandwiches, secrets.(Whispers)Share your secret, beautiful stranger."
The Deep End,Mermando,That wet sandwich does look delicious.
The Deep End,Narration,(Mermando's hair blows in the wind.)
The Deep End,Mermando,"Oh, very well. But you must never tell another living soul my terrible secret."
The Deep End,Narration,(Mabel nods.)
The Deep End,Mermando,You have to stay away from me because I am...
The Deep End,Narration,(Mermando pushes his inflatable raft away from him.)
The Deep End,Mermando,...Amerman.
The Deep End,Mabel,"Oh, thank goodness. I thought you were gonna say you had a girlfriend!"
The Deep End,Narration,(Cuts to commercial break.)
The Deep End,Mabel,A merman... ha! I should have known from your strange foreign fish language.
The Deep End,Mermando,It is Spanish.
The Deep End,Mabel,Your voice is so deep and masculine... how old are you?
The Deep End,Mermando,"I am 12 years old. Merman's voices change when we are, like, 3."
The Deep End,Mabel,So what's your name?
The Deep End,Merman,There are some who call me...(plays chord on guitar)Mermando! This is because Mermando is my name.
The Deep End,Mabel,"But I don't understand, Mermando. What's a guy like you doing in a public pool?"
The Deep End,Mermando,"It is a tragic story, Mabel."
The Deep End,Narration,(A flashback backs)
The Deep End,Mermando (Narrating),"I was swimming with my friends, the mighty dolphins, in the Gulf of Mexico, when I was ensnared!"
The Deep End,Narration,(Flashback Mermando is seen swimming with dolphins until he is caught in a fishing net and brought up next to a boat)
The Deep End,Davey,"(Flashback)Earl, did we just catch ourselves some kind of beautiful man-fish?"
The Deep End,Earl,(Flashback)Let's feast on his flesh.
The Deep End,Mermando (Narrating),The cargo was headed for Gravity Falls.
The Deep End,Narration,(Flashback Mermando opens up the back of a truck and hops into the lake.)
The Deep End,Mermando (Narrating),"Using all my strength, I tried to escape back home, but it was not to be."
The Deep End,Narration,"(Flashback Mermando swims up a waterfall. When he reaches the top, he laughs, but suddenly, a log hits him in the face. He falls and lands into the forest surrounding the lake. He spits a tooth out.)"
The Deep End,Mermando (Narrating),"I would have died of dehydration, were it not for the kindness of the forest animals."
The Deep End,Narration,(Flashback deer come up to flashback Mermando and start licking him.)
The Deep End,Mermando (Flashback),(Laughs)Continue licking! Oh!
The Deep End,Narration,"(Flashback Mermando falls down a pipe, through the forest, over the fence of the Gravity Falls pool, and into the pool. He gasps for air.)"
The Deep End,Narration,(The flashback ends.)
The Deep End,Mermando,"But now that you know what I am, you must be seriously weirded out."
The Deep End,Mabel,"What?! I don't care that you're a merman. You're, like, the coolest guy I've ever met. And you can play at least one chord on the guitar."
The Deep End,Mermando,"Oh, Mabel, I have never met another human like you. Would you care to join me in a game of the Marco Polo?"
The Deep End,Mabel,"Oh, yes, Mermando! Yes!"
The Deep End,Narration,(Mabel crushes Mermando in a hug.)
The Deep End,Mermando,You are covering my gills. I cannot breathe.
The Deep End,Narration,(Mabel quickly lets go. Mermando gasps.)
The Deep End,Mabel,(Chuckles)Weird.
The Deep End,Narration,Cuts toGideonputting sunscreen on himself on the lawn chair Stan wanted.
The Deep End,Gideon,Ooh!(giggles)My cheeks are baby soft.
The Deep End,Narration,Cuts to Stan watching Gideon from afar.
The Deep End,Stan,"(Growls)Look at him, that smug chair stealing jerk! But I can't touch him, or the pool patrol will throw me in pool jail. Hmm..."
The Deep End,Narration,(The light of the sun hits Stan's watch)
The Deep End,Stan,Ah!
The Deep End,Narration,(Stan makes an attempt to shine the light on his watch at Gideon)
The Deep End,Stan,Yes. Yes! Burn the child...
The Deep End,Narration,"(Gideon holds up his goggles, which bounces the light back into Stan's eyes)"
The Deep End,Stan,Aah! My eyes!
The Deep End,Narration,(Stan falls into the pool.)
The Deep End,Gideon,"(Puts his goggles on)Deal with it.(Stan comes out of the water, completely enraged)"
The Deep End,Narration,(Camera pans to Soos putting on an inflatable duck)
The Deep End,Duck,Soos.
The Deep End,Soos,"Inflatable duck guy, is that you?"
The Deep End,Duck,"Yes, Soos, I cantalk."
The Deep End,Soos,"Oh my gosh, I knew you guys were secretly alive. Iknewit!"
The Deep End,Narration,"(Wendy and Dipper are around the corner with a megaphone, looking at Soos, as they are the ones making the inflatable duck talk. They laugh and tell each other to shush quietly.)"
The Deep End,Duck,"My people have been enslaved, Soos. You must free us."
The Deep End,Soos,(Prepares to enter pool supplies closet)The inflatable pool duck revolution is at hand.
The Deep End,Narration,"(Dipper and Wendy laugh, but suddenly they hear a whistle. Poolcheck is seen driving the pool mobile with a megaphone in his hand)"
The Deep End,Mr. Poolcheck,"Pool's closing! Clear out, everyone!"
The Deep End,Dipper,Poolcheck!
The Deep End,Wendy,Hide!(They both attempt to run away)
The Deep End,Mr. Poolcheck,Out!(Shouts at Soos next to pool supplies room)Do notTOUCH!!(Calls to Dipper)Assistant Lifeguard!
The Deep End,Narration,"(Dipper stops, incredibly nervous)"
The Deep End,Mr. Poolcheck,"Have a good night, son. Lock up the supplies for me."
The Deep End,Narration,"(Poolcheck takes off his hand and pats it a couple of times. A pair of keys come out of it, which Dipper nervously takes and locks up the supplies room with.)"
The Deep End,Narration,"(Cuts to Mabel and Mermando brushing each others hair, when the whistle blows.)"
The Deep End,Mermando,"The pool, she closes. Can I see you tonight?"
The Deep End,Mabel,Sure. Where? Wanna go for a walk?
The Deep End,Mermando,Merman. I am a merman.
The Deep End,Mabel,"Oh, right.(Gets out of the pool)Then I'll be back tonight."
The Deep End,Narration,"(At night, Mabel drives thegolf cartto the pool. She climbs up the fence with a pool skimmer, damaging it. Mabel goes in the pool with Mermando.)"
The Deep End,Mabel,Look! Here's a scrapbook of human stuff.(Points at the scrapbook)Here's me standing with my legs. And here I am kicking Dipper in his legs. He couldn't move his legs after that! Can you imagine? Not having legs?
The Deep End,Mermando,(A bit uncomfortable)Let's skip this part.
The Deep End,Mabel,(Points at another picture)And here's my whole family kickboxing!
The Deep End,Mermando,"(Sighs, and swims away from Mabel)"
The Deep End,Mabel,(Follows him)What's wrong?
The Deep End,Narration,"Mermando takes his guitar out and plays it, but it doesn't sound well. He angrily pours the water out and starts to talk."
The Deep End,Mermando,"I too, used to have a family once, back in the ocean.(opens his shell necklace and looks at his family's picture.)How I miss them.(Closes the necklace)"
The Deep End,Mabel,"Mermando, why don't you just leave the pool?"
The Deep End,Mermando,"I've tried only once, but escaping this pool required a plan that was bold and daring."
The Deep End,Narration,"Cuts to Mermando's past memory he tried to escape. He jumps out the pool but he doesn't gets far and flaps for water. He hits chairs, a parasol, and gets pecked by a woodpecker. Then he rolls into the pool."
The Deep End,Mermando,"And then the wolves came.(To Mabel, changing the topic)No, I'm glad that I'm here, 'cause I met you."
The Deep End,Narration,Next to Mermando a shooting star falls down.
The Deep End,Mabel,"(Thinking)This is it, Mabel. First kiss moment, here we come! Just go for it!(Tries to kiss)"
The Deep End,Mermando,What are you doing with your mouth?
The Deep End,Mabel,"Me? Nothing. This? I was eating some sour candy. So my lips were doing that, 'cause the candy was so sour."
The Deep End,Mermando,(Pause)Can I have some candy?
The Deep End,Mabel,(Pause)No.
The Deep End,Narration,"It becomes daytime.Sheriff BlubsandDeputy Durlandare putting suncreams on. Then, Sheriff Blubs gets trapped by a life saver fallen from the top."
The Deep End,Sheriff Blubs,Wha-what the?
The Deep End,Narration,Deputy Durland gets trapped too.
The Deep End,Deputy Durland,I'm scared!
The Deep End,Blubs,Me too!
The Deep End,Narration,The camera pans up showing Wendy and Dipper were throwing the life savers.
The Deep End,Dipper,One hundred points!
The Deep End,Wendy,"Dude! With this job, you and me are gonna be havin' fun all summer!"
The Deep End,Dipper,(Blushing)All summer?
The Deep End,Narration,Mr. Poolcheck blows a whistle.
The Deep End,Mr. Poolcheck,(Pointing at Blubs and Durland)PINES! HERE!NOW!!
The Deep End,Narration,Cut to Mr. Poolcheck berating Dipper in front of the pool supplies closet.
The Deep End,Mr. Poolcheck,You gave me your word that you would respect the sacred rules of this municipal pool!
The Deep End,Dipper,"Mr. Poolcheck, are you crying?"
The Deep End,Mr. Poolcheck,"(Snaps back at Dipper, his face is livid red)That's not important right now!!(Wipes his eyes, points at Dipper)You are on thin ice, boy! You wanna keep this job?! Well, some maniac broke into the supplies closet last night and destroyed our one and only pool skimmer! I want you on a stakeout. IF ONE MORE SUPPLY GETS TAKEN,YOU'RE FIRED!!"
The Deep End,Dipper,(Salutes)I won't let you down!
The Deep End,Narration,Cut to Mabel and Mermando at the pool.
The Deep End,Mabel,"Mermando, get ready! I'm gonna BRING THE HEAT!(Throws the ball to Mermando)BOOSH!"
The Deep End,Narration,Mermando gets hit by the ball sadly.
The Deep End,Mabel,"Mermando, are you okay?"
The Deep End,Narration,Mermando swims to Mabel.
The Deep End,Mabel,"Oh, it's your family, isn't it? Are you thinking about them?"
The Deep End,Narration,Mermando makes a sad dolphin chirp.
The Deep End,Mabel,"Mermando, enough is enough! I care about you too much to see you like this. We're gonna bust you out of here and get you back to your family."
The Deep End,Mermando,"But, Mabel, escape is impossible!"
The Deep End,Mabel,We're breaking you out of here TONIGHT!
The Deep End,Narration,Mabel hits the water which splashes.
The Deep End,Mabel,Whoops! Sorry about that. Water.
The Deep End,Narration,"At night, Dipper guards the pool wearing a ""Night Patrol"" cap. He paces back and forth holding a flashlight."
The Deep End,Dipper,"Alright, Dipper, here's the plan. Catch the trespasser, protect the supplies, keep job at pool, and eventually marry Wendy.(Dipper hears a sound)Freeze!"
The Deep End,Narration,Dipper turns to the place where the sound is heard. It turns out to be Stan cutting the fence.
The Deep End,Dipper,Grunkle Stan?
The Deep End,Stan,"I, uh... I'm sleepwalking! Also now I'm sleep-talking.(Points at the hat)Nice hat, by the way."
The Deep End,Dipper,You! You're the one destroying pool supplies!
The Deep End,Stan,What? No! My crime is a lot better than that.(Walks through the fence)I'm gonna get that seat and be ready in the morning when Gideon comes. Then maybe I'll destory some pool supplies. Night's still young.
The Deep End,Narration,Dipper takes a deep breath and blows the whistle loudly.
The Deep End,Stan,"(Backs off)Yeesh, alright, I'm goin'!"
The Deep End,Narration,"Stan walks a little, then runs to the pool."
The Deep End,Dipper,Hey!
The Deep End,Narration,"Dipper chases after him. Then, Mabel emerges from a bush, driving the golf cart in reverse. Mermando notices Mabel by the lights."
The Deep End,Mermando,Mabel!(Swims to Mabel; she uses a hairpin to unlock the pool supplies door)
The Deep End,Mabel,Are you ready to see your family?
The Deep End,Mermando,"Yes, but how can I, a merman, possibly escape?"
The Deep End,Mabel,"(Takes out a paper of her sweater; presents a crude illustration to Mermando)Okay, my original plan was to tape together a bunch of fish sticks to make you a prosthetic pair of people legs."
The Deep End,Mermando,Intriguing.(He now sees Mabel fill up a cooler box with a hose on back of the golf cart)
The Deep End,Mabel,But then I realized I could just transport you in this cooler.
The Deep End,Mermando,Ha-ha!
The Deep End,Narration,"(Mermando leaps out of the pool. After a pause, he hops into the cooler.)"
The Deep End,Dipper,(Shouts offscreen)Hey! Who's there?!
The Deep End,Mermando,Quick! Hide me! My kind must not be seen!(Mabel closes the cooler before Dipper arrives)
The Deep End,Dipper,"Mabel? Is there anyone not breaking into the pool tonight? What, is Soos here too?(Behind him, Soos climbs over the fence and drops down)"
The Deep End,Soos,I'm okay.
The Deep End,Dipper,"Go home, Soos."
The Deep End,Soos,You got it.(He attempts to climb back up the fence again)
The Deep End,Dipper,"So, why are you here?"
The Deep End,Mabel,"(Nervously)Uh, no reason.(Mermando clears his throat)"
The Deep End,Dipper,Did that cooler just clear its throat?
The Deep End,Mabel,"Don't be silly. There certainly isn't a merman in there, if that's what you're implying. Who said anything about a merman?"
The Deep End,Dipper,"Mabel, I don't have time for your games. If you don't give me those supplies, I'll lose the coolest job ever!"
The Deep End,Mabel,"(sighs) I understand.(Suddenly points the other direction)Hey, look! Wendy in a bikini!"
The Deep End,Dipper,"(Turns around, distracted)Really? At night?"
The Deep End,Mabel,"Sorry, Dipper!(She drives the cart through the fence, next to Stan's hole on the right)"
The Deep End,Dipper,(Angrily)MABEL!!
The Deep End,Narration,"(Dipper runs to the pool mobile. He buckles his seatbelt, turns the ignition key and drives after Mabel through the fence hole)"
The Deep End,Pool Jail kid,"Go, Mabel, go! We can't all be saved.(Sees a bag of corn chips float towards him. He takes a chip in his mouth)"
The Deep End,Narration,Next scene shows Dipper's pool mobile speeding after Mabel's cart throughMain Street. Mabel glances back at the cooler.
The Deep End,Mabel,I'm gonna get you home!(Mermando gives a thumbs up; he narrowly avoids a water balloon thrown by Dipper)
The Deep End,Dipper,(Through megaphone)Hand over the pool supplies in the name of pool law!
The Deep End,Mabel,Pool law is dumb! And so is your hat!
The Deep End,Narration,"Dipper continues to launch more water balloons at the golf cart. Mabel dodges them. She sees a sign that reads ""Lake 3 Miles"" and is pointed right."
The Deep End,Mabel,Look!Gravity Falls lake!(She takes a right turn with Dipper tailing behind her)
The Deep End,Narration,Cut back to the pool. Stan comes out from the women's bathroom.
The Deep End,Stan,The coast is clear.(He hurries to the chair and lies down)Ahh... Now all I have to do is wait here 15 hours until the pool opens.(He stares straight ahead for a pause)This was a good plan.
The Deep End,Narration,"Meanwhile, Dipper chases Mabel down a winding forest road. They speed past a patrol car next to a Lil' Gideon billboard."
The Deep End,Blubs,I think someone just sped by.
The Deep End,Durland,Probably just a dream.
The Deep End,Blubs,"With you, every day is a dream."
The Deep End,Narration,"Dipper launches another water balloon, which knocks the knob off the cooler and releases water. Inside the cooler, Mermando gasps and starts to suffocate."
The Deep End,Mermando,I cannot breathe! You must hurry!
The Deep End,Narration,"They pass another sign: ""Welcome to Lake Gravity Falls"". Mabel drives the cart towards the lake, then hits the brakes, causing her and the cooler to fall off the cart. Dipper stops the mobile and runs over to Mabel and the cooler."
The Deep End,Mabel,I'm okay.
The Deep End,Dipper,"Alright, the jig is up! Hand over that cooler!"
The Deep End,Mabel,(Grasps the cooler)Never!
The Deep End,Dipper,Why not?! Why do you even need it?!
The Deep End,Mabel,(Hesitates before telling the truth)I needed the cooler to save my new friend because he needs to go home and he's really nice and we combed each others' hair and he needs to be in the cooler because he breathes water because he's a merman!(She opens the cooler)
The Deep End,Mermando,"(Mermando rolls out of the cooler, waves to Dipper)Hola."
The Deep End,Dipper,"Whoa! Way to bury the lead, Mabel."
The Deep End,Mabel,"Dipper, Mermando the merman. He's a merman."
The Deep End,Mermando,"Nice to meet you. Also, I think I am dying.(Gasps and suffocates on the floor. His face is turning blue)Water!¡Agua! ¡Yo necesito!"
The Deep End,Mabel,"Oh, no! Mermando! Dipper, you're a lifeguard! Give him CPR!"
The Deep End,Dipper,Mermen don't breathe air!
The Deep End,Mabel,Then give himreverseCPR! Doi!
The Deep End,Narration,Dipper runs to the pool car and grabs a bottle of water. He runs back and leans over Mermando and steals himself. He squirts water into his mouth and starts resuscitating Mermando through mouth-to-mouth.
The Deep End,Dipper,I hate this! I hate this!
The Deep End,Mabel,(Takes a photo. Laughs)Blackmail!
The Deep End,Mermando,"Thank you for saving me, but why didn't you just roll me into the lake?(Mermando gestures to the lake which is only a foot away.)"
The Deep End,Narration,Dipper smacks his forehead in frustration.
The Deep End,Narration,"Later, Mabel and Dipper carry Mermando down a pier and throw him into the lake."
The Deep End,Mermando,"(Making dolphin sounds, then coughs)I am weak from coughing. How will I get my family to hear my call from the mighty depths of the ocean?"
The Deep End,Mabel,I've got it. BRB.(She grabs a megaphone from the pool mobile)Problem solved!
The Deep End,Dipper,"(Snatches megaphone from Mabel)Mabel, those are pool supplies. I'll get fired!"
The Deep End,Mabel,"Dipper! Don't you know what it's like to fall for someone? Even though you know in your heart that it'll probably never work out, but you'd do anything for that person?"
The Deep End,Dipper,(sighs)Give Mermando the megaphone.
The Deep End,Mabel,"Thanks, Dip.(She tosses the meagphone to Mermando)"
The Deep End,Mermando,"Mabel, I have never met anyone like you."
The Deep End,Mabel,"Same here. Except for a zombie, a gnome, and a couple of cute vampires."
The Deep End,Dipper,I don't remember the vampires.
The Deep End,Mabel,"I don't tell you everything.(To Mermando)Well, Mermando, I guess this is it."
The Deep End,Mermando,Not quite. This is!(He leaps up and kisses Mabel.)
The Deep End,Dipper,"Whoa! Okay, that's gross. Ugh."
The Deep End,Mabel,"That was my first kiss! Hey, it was also kind of your first kiss too, huh? Huh?"
The Deep End,Dipper,(Shudders)Please don't involve me in this.
The Deep End,Mabel,"Goodbye, Mermando."
The Deep End,Mermando,"Goodbye, Mabel.(He swims off toward the waterfall)"
The Deep End,Mabel,"You did the right thing, Dipper."
The Deep End,Dipper,"Yeah, yeah.(The twins walk along the pier toward the two carts)"
The Deep End,Mabel,"Oh, wait, wait! One last thing!(Runs onto a small rocky peninsula. Mermando leaps over her head)Yes! I've always wanted to do that."
The Deep End,Narration,(Morning at the pool...)
The Deep End,Mr. Poolcheck,"A wrecked fence, dents in the pool mobile, and a missing megaphone?!(He grips Dipper, extremely livid)WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS?!!"
The Deep End,Dipper,"It's my fault, sir. I'm sorry. I got in too deep."
The Deep End,Mr. Poolcheck,"HAND OVER THEWHISTLE, BOY!!"
The Deep End,Narration,"Dipper hands Poolcheck the whistle, who then proceeds to put it in his mouth and crunches it with his teeth. Dipper slowly backs away as Poolcheck swallows the whistle."
The Deep End,Poolcheck,If one more thing goes wrong today—
The Deep End,Narration,Soos then emerges out of the pool supplies closet and throws the inflatable ducks over the fence.
The Deep End,Soos,You're free now! Free! Inflatable ducks unite!
The Deep End,Mr. Poolcheck,(Points at Soos)YOU!!!!
The Deep End,Soos,"Huh? Aah!(He frantically climbs over the fence. Poolcheck runs through the fence after Soos, screaming like a ferocious beast)"
The Deep End,Tyler Cutebiker,Git 'em! Git 'em!
The Deep End,Narration,"Cut to Dipper walking away sadly. Suddenly, a water balloon hits his face."
The Deep End,Wendy,"Hey, doofus, you'll never guess what happened. I just got fired."
The Deep End,Dipper,"(Surprised, smiling)What? Really?"
The Deep End,Wendy,Yeah. I guess Poolcheck found out I was taking too many snacks.
The Deep End,Dipper,How many?
The Deep End,Narration,Wendy lifts her hat and reveals a stack of Corncorno packs on her head. Dipper laughs.
The Deep End,Wendy,"Hey, wanna go break rules somewhere else?"
The Deep End,Dipper,"Of course!(They walk off together, laughing)"
The Deep End,Narration,"Mabel is sitting by the pool, sighs. Then a bottle pops out from a grate."
The Deep End,Mabel,"""Dear Mabel,(Mermando's voice plays in the background)I am home with my family and I am very happy."""
The Deep End,Mermando,"""Our first kiss will always hold a place in my heart. Technically hearts... As a merman I have, like, 17 hearts. Horrifying but true! More bottles on the way!"""
The Deep End,Narration,"More bottles pop out of the grate, Mabel giggles. Meanwhile, Gideon approaches Stan."
The Deep End,Gideon,"Stanford!(Stan laughs)Well, guess you've won. Put 'er there.(He offers a handshake. Stan reaches to shake Gideon's hand but is stuck to the chair)"
The Deep End,Stan,Hey! What the—
The Deep End,Gideon,"Unless perhaps I predicted your plan, and coated the entire chair with glue last night! Enjoy your chair...forever.(He laughs as he walks away. Stan struggles to get off his chair)"
The Deep End,Stan,"Kids, get the spatulas!KIDS!!"
The Deep End,Narration,Cut to end credits
The Deep End,Narration,"Pool jail boy stares up at the sky from his prison as the seasons pass. In nighttime on the 4th of July, fireworks explode as the boy waves a mini US flag with one star 'á la sticker' wave."
The Deep End,Narration,End.
Carpet Diem,Narration,The episode opens with an eyeball rolling into a cup.
Carpet Diem,Mabel Pines,"Hwaah! Total domination! I am the master of Attic Stuff Mini-golf! From the mighty Swiss Alps, to the badlands of Dipper's old laundry where man fears to tread!"
Carpet Diem,Dipper Pines,"(Walks to another golf ball and prepares to hit it)Alright, let a pro on the field, or floor. Whatever."
Carpet Diem,Narration,Dipper hits the eyeball very hard. The eyeball bounces around the room and crashes through a window.
Carpet Diem,Grunkle Stan,"(Off-screen)Ah, my head! It hit me right in the head!"
Carpet Diem,Dipper,Yes! Stan shot. Is that legal?
Carpet Diem,Narration,"Mabel and Dipper look at the judge,Waddles, and see him eating the score card."
Carpet Diem,Mabel,The judges say it's out of bounds.
Carpet Diem,Dipper,You're out of bounds!(Lightly jabs Mabel in the stomach with his golf club)
Carpet Diem,Mabel,Hey! Watch it!(Jabs Dipper lightly in the stomach with her golf club)
Carpet Diem,Narration,Dipper and Mabel continue jabbing each other for a few seconds until Mabel'sMeow o'clockclock starts ringing.
Carpet Diem,Mabel,"Hey, Dipper, I gotta go hang out withCandyandGrendatonight."
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"Aw, again? You can't leave mid-game."
Carpet Diem,Mabel,"Don't be silly, I'm not leaving. My friends are coming to me!"
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"Wait, what? Oh no. No no no. Sleeping bags?(Looks at sleeping bags)Rom-coms?(Looks at romantic comedies)Calling All Boys: Preteen Edition?!?(Looks at the game)You're not having a—"
Carpet Diem,Narration,The door opens and showsCandyandGrendagrinning in the shadows. They walk in and interrupt Dipper and finish his sentence.
Carpet Diem,Candy Chiu and Grenda,Sleepover!
Carpet Diem,Dipper,(Screams in horror)
Carpet Diem,Narration,Cuts totheme song
Carpet Diem,Narration,"Mabel, Grenda, Candy, and Waddles are sitting on the floor, talking."
Carpet Diem,Mabel,"Okay, so how much do you like boys?"
Carpet Diem,Grenda,So much!
Carpet Diem,Candy,Boys make me think about kissing!
Carpet Diem,Grenda,Candy! Oh my gosh!(Throws a pillow at Candy which hits her in the head)
Carpet Diem,Candy,Ow.
Carpet Diem,Mabel,We are so crazy tonight!(Starts screaming)
Carpet Diem,Candy,(Joins Mabel in screaming)
Carpet Diem,Grenda,(Screams with them)
Carpet Diem,Narration,Dipper is seen on his bed with a pillow over his ears.
Carpet Diem,Grenda,Who wants to smear makeup on my face?
Carpet Diem,Mabel,"Ugh, you're already so beautiful, Grenda. What would be the point?"
Carpet Diem,Grenda,(Starts punching the floor)Beautiful! Beautiful!
Carpet Diem,Dipper,Arrrrgh! Mabel! Do you think you can do this somewhere else?! You're laughing at frequencies only dogs should hear!
Carpet Diem,Mabel,"Come on, it's not that bad."
Carpet Diem,Grenda,You know what your brother needs?
Carpet Diem,Mabel,(Gasps)A makeover?
Carpet Diem,Candy,(Holds up beauty products)
Carpet Diem,Dipper,(Screams)
Carpet Diem,Narration,"Dipper is seen walking in the hallway with his blanket and pillow. He walks up toSoos, who is screwing something in."
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"(Sigh)Hey, Soos, can I sleep in your break room tonight?"
Carpet Diem,Soos Ramirez,"Of course, dude."
Carpet Diem,Narration,(Soos opens the door to reveal a very cramped room with hazardous pipes and steam)
Carpet Diem,Soos,"You just gotta make your body go like a video game puzzle block. Beebity boop boop beep beepity boop bop boop boop.(Gets into the room by moving his body into an odd position)The trick is to hold perfectly still.(Rests his hand on a pipe and his arm gets scorched)Ow, wait wait.(Does it again)Ow, wait wait.(Does it again)Ow, wait wait."
Carpet Diem,Dipper,I think I'll sleep somewhere else...
Carpet Diem,Narration,"Dipper walks away while Soos continues doing the same thing over and over again, Soos said ""Oh, actually felt good that time"". Cuts to Dipper outside on the ground."
Carpet Diem,Dipper,Ah...sleeping under the stars...not bad.
Carpet Diem,Narration,Dipper hears a growling sounds and gets up. He sees a wolf biting on his leg
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"Aaah!! Get off! Aah! Get away!(Looks up and sees Mabel's sleepover from the window. Mabel, Grenda, and Candy are jumping up and down, singing loudly)"
Carpet Diem,"Mabel, Candy, and Grenda",Lalalalala! ...Disco Girls!...
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"(Looks down at the wolf)This is still better.(Lays down again, the wolf continues to gnaw on his leg)"
Carpet Diem,Narration,"Cuts to the next day. Mabel wakes up in a state of confusion. She has her hair messed up with the words ""PARTY GURL"" written on her forehead."
Carpet Diem,Mabel,Ugh...what happened last night? Whoa!(sees Candy taped to the ceiling)
Carpet Diem,Candy,"What's up, party girl?"
Carpet Diem,Grenda,"(Walks out of the closet with lipstick all over her face)I don't know what I was kissing in there, but I have no regrets!"
Carpet Diem,Candy,Candy falls down now.(Falls from the ceiling and knocks down the Eiffel Tower from the twins' attic stiff golf game)
Carpet Diem,Mabel,"That was awesome, girls.(Fixes up her hair and waves)See you again soon!"
Carpet Diem,Narration,Candy and Grenda walk out of the room and Dipper enters with a black eye and twigs in his hair and lays on his bed)
Carpet Diem,Mabel,"Hey, brother! Want any of this leftover pizza? It's got glitter on it!"
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"Mabel, last night an owl tried to eat my tongue."
Carpet Diem,Mabel,Ha ha! That's great!
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"(Gets up from his bed)No, it's not great! This(gestures to their dirty and wrecked room)is impossible to live with!"
Carpet Diem,Mabel,What? I'm delightful to live with! Get ready to be poked by the fun stick! Boop!(Takes a stick and pokes Dipper with it)
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"Ah!(Slaps it out of Mabel's hand)Mabel, I've had it with the fun stick! You've totally wrecked our room. And—(gasps)—oh no! Our mini-golf course!"
Carpet Diem,Mabel,"Heh heh heh, yeah. Grenda sure loves breaking things."
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"Mabel, we need to lay down some ground rules if we're gonna be living in this room together. First of all, no sleepovers."
Carpet Diem,Mabel,"What?! Well if I can't have sleepovers, then you can't keep me up every night with your summer reading."
Carpet Diem,Dipper,How does reading keep you up?
Carpet Diem,Narration,Flashbacks to a night an unknown time ago.
Carpet Diem,Dipper,(Gasps)Ooh... heh heh heh... interesting... but who stole the capers?(Clicks pen several times)
Carpet Diem,Mabel,Grr...!(Puts pillow over her head)
Carpet Diem,Narration,Cuts back to the present day
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"Well, at least my braces don't whistle when I breathe."
Carpet Diem,Mabel,At least I wash my clothes once in a while.(Picks up a pair of underwear with the fun stick)
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"Washing clothes is a waste of time, I'm a busy guy!"
Carpet Diem,Mabel,(talks with hand)Meow meow meow meow meow!
Carpet Diem,Dipper,Alright if you meow one more time—
Carpet Diem,Mabel,"(talks with hand)Meow, meow, meow!"
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"Okay, that's it! That's the final straw! Maybe we shouldn't share a room anymore."
Carpet Diem,Mabel,Wah...uh...well maybe we shouldn't!
Carpet Diem,Dipper,Fine by me!
Carpet Diem,Mabel,Double fine by me!
Carpet Diem,Dipper,Then we need to talk to Grunkle Stan about moving rooms.
Carpet Diem,Mabel,Yeah. He's a reasonable guy.
Carpet Diem,Narration,Cuts to Stan watching a show with two guys pushing each other.
Carpet Diem,Stan,"Fight, fight, fight!(Changes the channel to a station that has two deer fighting each other)"
Carpet Diem,Stan,"Fight, fight, fight!(Changes the channel again to a station airingBaby Fights)"
Carpet Diem,Stan,"Fight, fight, fight!"
Carpet Diem,Narration,One baby is poked with a stick and the two begin slapping each other.
Carpet Diem,T.V. Announcer,Baby fights!
Carpet Diem,Stan,T.V. It knows what I want.
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"Grunkle Stan, we want different rooms."
Carpet Diem,Stan,Ha! And I want a pair of magic money pants. It's not gonna happen.
Carpet Diem,Mabel,Magic money pants...?
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"Come on, Grunkle Stan. Can't we work something out?"
Carpet Diem,Stan,"Look kid, there's my room and the attic. That's it. What do you think, there's some kinda ""secret hidden room"" in theShack?"
Carpet Diem,Narration,A very loud crash is heard.
Carpet Diem,Soos,(Off screen)Dudes! I found some kind of secret hidden room in the Shack!
Carpet Diem,Narration,Dipper and Mabel grin at each other. Cuts to all of them looking at Soos with a door.
Carpet Diem,Soos,"Okay, so I was cleaning up behind this bookcase when boom! Mystery door! This old Shack is full of weird secrets.(Opens door and they all look into it. Dipper and Mabel walk into it and look around)"
Carpet Diem,Dipper,Whoa-hoh!
Carpet Diem,Mabel,Classy...
Carpet Diem,Dipper,(Looks at a calendar)
Carpet Diem,Mabel,(blows the dust off a small mirror and she coughs)
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"(Looks at the tag on theshag carpet.)Experiment 78? Grunkle Stan, what is this place?"
Carpet Diem,Stan,I don't know. Just another room I gotta clean up now.(Takes a pair of glasses off a table and puts it in his shirt)
Carpet Diem,Mabel,(Makes snow angels in the carpet)This carpet is amazing!
Carpet Diem,Stan,"Yeah, if you're into things that are terrible."
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"(Sees a key hanging on the wall and grabs it)Problem solved, I'll move in here!"
Carpet Diem,Mabel,What? Why do you automatically get the room? We both saw it at the same time.
Carpet Diem,Stan,"Wait a second.(Takes the key from Dipper)So you both want this room, huh? I guess I'll give it to whichever one of you I like more.(Unties his own shoe)Uh oh. Looks like my shoe's untied."
Carpet Diem,Narration,Dipper and Mabel look at each other for a second before attacking each other trying to tie Stan's shoe.
Carpet Diem,Stan,"Muah ha ha. To the kitchen! Fight, fight, fight!"
Carpet Diem,Narration,"Stan runs to the kitchen and Dipper and Mabel let go of his shoe. They get up to follow him out the exit, but Soos blocks the door."
Carpet Diem,Soos,"Whoa! I don't know dudes, this room gives me major, creep-o vibes. Y'know, the attic is a pretty good space. Maybe you two should appreciate what you got."
Carpet Diem,Narration,Dipper and Mabel look at each other before running past Soos.
Carpet Diem,Soos,"Heh. Hey, what do I know?(grabs a broom and starts sweeping)Maybe there's nothing creepy going on in this room."
Carpet Diem,Narration,"The camera then shows the carpet's tag that says ""Experiment 78,"" and the tag is crackling with electricity. Cuts to commercial break."
Carpet Diem,Narration,"Dipper and Mabel are in the kitchen, elbowing each other."
Carpet Diem,Stan,"(Holds up key)Okay, here's how it's gonna go down. Whoever sucks-up the hardest get's the key to the new room."
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"Grunkle Stan, we're not gonna suck-up to you just to get the new room."
Carpet Diem,Mabel,Yeah we are!
Carpet Diem,Stan,Ten suck-up points for Mabel!
Carpet Diem,Dipper,I mean—uh—yeah we are!
Carpet Diem,Stan,Trying too hard. Minus 15 suck-up points.
Carpet Diem,Dipper,What?
Carpet Diem,Mabel,Good decision Grunkle Stan!
Carpet Diem,Stan,Trying way too hard! Plus 50 suck-up points!
Carpet Diem,Dipper,(Expression darkens)
Carpet Diem,Stan,"(Holds up a bucket filled with tiles)Now, who wants to re-tile the roof in searing 105 degree heat?"
Carpet Diem,Dipper and Mabel,Me me! I'll do it!
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"(Runs up, takes the bucket, and runs outside)"
Carpet Diem,Mabel,"No, Dipper, give it here!(Chases him)"
Carpet Diem,Stan,"He he. Stan, you're a good uncle."
Carpet Diem,Mabel,(Outside)Gimme it!
Carpet Diem,Dipper,(Outside)No!
Carpet Diem,Mabel,It's mine!
Carpet Diem,Dipper,Mine!
Carpet Diem,Mabel,I'll kill you!
Carpet Diem,Narration,Cuts to Dipper and Mabel mowing the lawn while Stan watches them. Dipper stops for a second to take a break.
Carpet Diem,Stan,"Dipper, you're phoning it in!"
Carpet Diem,Dipper,(Continues mowing)
Carpet Diem,Stan,"(Drinks lemonade)Man, that's refreshing. 10 suck-up points for this lemonade!(Pretending to be lemonade)Thank you, Stan!(Normal voice)Oh-ho! 10 more for politeness.(Takes a sip)Oh, and so sweet!"
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"(Opens door to the room; sighs)All these chores will be worth it when I get this room. Shag carpeting? Come on!(Takes off shoes and begins shuffling feet on the carpet, and electricity builds up around his legs)"
Carpet Diem,Mabel,Hey brother. Don't get too comfortable. I just made Stan an omelet shaped like his own face.
Carpet Diem,Narration,Cuts to Stan looking at his omelet.
Carpet Diem,Stan,I have seen the face of beauty...(Starts eating)
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"(Starts circling Mabel, building up more electricity)"
Carpet Diem,Mabel,Face it. I'm like a suck-up ninja. This room's as good as mine. You might as well give up now. What do you say?(Stretches out hand)
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"I say I'm gonna win this room somehow, and when I do I'll finally have my own space...(raises hand)... and we'll never have to share anything ever again!"
Carpet Diem,Narration,"Dipper slaps Mabel's hand away, electrocuting Mabel, and causing a huge glow in between them."
Carpet Diem,Both,Aaaaah!
Carpet Diem,Mabel?,(Sits up)Ugh...what happened?
Carpet Diem,Dipper?,Dipper? Why are you wearing my clothes... and my... face?! Am I in your body?!
Carpet Diem,Dipper,Am I inyourbody?!
Carpet Diem,Mabel,(Screams)
Carpet Diem,Dipper,(Screams)
Carpet Diem,Mabel,(Screams)
Carpet Diem,Dipper,(Screams)
Carpet Diem,Mabel,(Throws up in the bathroom toilet)
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"(Runs to a mirror and is in Mabel's body)Aaah!(Runs off, but runs back soon after)Aaah!"
Carpet Diem,Mabel,"(Punching Dipper's stomach)Get out, get out, get out!"
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"(In the corner)This isn't happening, this isn't happening, this isn't happening..."
Carpet Diem,Mabel,(Her shadow is seen on the wall and she screams)
Carpet Diem,Narration,"Cuts to Dipper and Mabel looking at their new, swapped bodies in the mirror."
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"Great! Just what we need, moreGravity Fallsweirdness."
Carpet Diem,Mabel,"This is stupid! Sharing a room was bad enough, now we're sharing bodies?"
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"Ugh, braces are horrible. It's like my mouth hates me. And what are these things?(Pokes Mabel's loose hair)"
Carpet Diem,Mabel,"I don't know why you're so sweaty, and awkward."
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"Hey look. Experiment 78.(Walks over to the tag on the carpet, and turns it around. On the back it says ""Electron Carpet"")Electron Carpet. Atoms can swap electrons. This carpet must build up a static charge so powerful it can swap minds!(Starts clicking pen)It was the static electricity! Maybe we can use it to switch back!"
Carpet Diem,Mabel,"Phew, ho ho! Glad I'm switching back. If I was you I would totally lose the contest."
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"And if I was you, which I am, I could sabotage myself! Then Mabel would lose all her points and the room would go to Dipper!"
Carpet Diem,Mabel,"Wait, what?"
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"Oh Stan! I've always hated you! Ha ha, see who he gives the room to now!"
Carpet Diem,Mabel,No! Wait!(Begins to chase him but trips)Tie your shoes!
Carpet Diem,Stan,(Finishes eating his omelet)Mm! Those cannibals are onto something. I taste delicious!
Carpet Diem,Dipper,Grunkle Stan!
Carpet Diem,Stan,"What's the word, Mabel?"
Carpet Diem,Dipper,That's right. It's me -(tucks hair behind her ear)- Mabel. If ya like that omelet you'll love this! A sandwich made out of rocks!(Pulls out a rock sandwich and gives it to Stan)
Carpet Diem,Stan,Candy rocks?
Carpet Diem,Dipper,(Shakes head)Regular rocks.
Carpet Diem,Stan,... Keep that up and I'll be giving your brother this key.
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"Ha ha! I mean, darn."
Carpet Diem,Mabel,Hey Grunkle Stan! Your face looks like a butt!
Carpet Diem,Stan,What?
Carpet Diem,Mabel,"Breaking stuff is so much fun, I am Dipper and I stink!(Kicks the oven and kicks bottles around)"
Carpet Diem,Dipper,Mabel's gone bananas! Zing! Zow! Ballow!(Pours cereal out of the box everywhere and laughs)
Carpet Diem,Stan,Well this is gettin' weird.(Gets up and walks away)
Carpet Diem,Dipper,Wait! Are you gonna dock Mabel points?
Carpet Diem,Mabel,Dipper should lose all his points!
Carpet Diem,Narration,"Mabel starts to chase him, but Dipper tackles her."
Carpet Diem,Dipper,Grunkle Stan!
Carpet Diem,Narration,"Cuts to Waddles rubbing against the carpet in the room, with Soos vacuuming nearby."
Carpet Diem,Soos,"Waddles, you got it good, bro. You got no worries. I mean, nobody thinks it's cute when I lie naked on the living room floor. I wish I could be a pig.(Rubs Waddles' head, the electrons are swapped, and they swap bodies)"
Carpet Diem,Soos,(Looks around)Yes! I should do out loud wishing more often.(Sniffs)Is that a corn cob I spy?(Climbs up the couch and out the window)I got little legs.
Carpet Diem,Narration,"Waddles looks around confused, as now he is in Soos' body, and tries to walk out the door. He hits it 3 times before leaving the room. Waddles walks into the gift shop and looks at the vending machine. He licks the glass cover and makes the postcard stand fall.Wendythen walks in."
Carpet Diem,Wendy Corduroy,"Hey Soos, what's up? Have you seen my—(Looks at Waddles in Soos' body)"
Carpet Diem,Waddles,(Chews on a t-shirt)
Carpet Diem,Wendy,"(Surprised)Uh, I'll come back later...(Leaves the gift shop)"
Carpet Diem,Narration,Cuts to Dipper in the hallway.
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"Grunkle Stan, come back! I have more terrible things to do! You're toast, Mabel! That room's as good as mine!(Runs off, but crashes into Grenda)"
Carpet Diem,Grenda,"There you are, Mabel!"
Carpet Diem,Candy,Attack her with love!
Carpet Diem,Grenda,Yeah!
Carpet Diem,Candy and Grenda,Sleepover!
Carpet Diem,Dipper,What!? No! No no no!
Carpet Diem,Narration,Grenda carries Candy and Dipper up the stairs.
Carpet Diem,Mabel,"(Runs after them)Dipper? Hey, wait! Come back!"
Carpet Diem,Narration,Grenda runs into the twin's old room.
Carpet Diem,Mabel,"Wait, come back! Hey, um, can I talk to my... sister, for a sec?"
Carpet Diem,Grenda,"This is a sleepover, buddy. No boys allowed!(Closes the door)"
Carpet Diem,Mabel,(Looks in through the keyhole)
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"Look guys, I'm not really in a sleepover mood right now. One of my, irrational girl mood swings, you know. Right? Don't we have those?"
Carpet Diem,Grenda,"Come on, my mom's age inappropriate romance novels aren't gonna read themselves. Ooh! ""Wolfman Bare Chest."""
Carpet Diem,Mabel,Ooh.
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"Uh, really. I should probably, uh—"
Carpet Diem,Grenda,"(Grabs Dipper and puts him on the bed)Come on! You know you love it! ""My name is Gerard. I am a werewolf, creature of the night. But I am also a creature of passion."""
Carpet Diem,Dipper,Oh.
Carpet Diem,Mabel,Gerard is just so fierce.
Carpet Diem,Stan,"What's going on, Dipper?"
Carpet Diem,Mabel,(Gasps and tries to cover the keyhole where she was looking in)
Carpet Diem,Stan,"Ah, you're at that creepy age where you spy on girls, huh? Guess it's time you and me had a man to man talk. About the birds and the bees, you know?"
Carpet Diem,Mabel,(Frowns)
Carpet Diem,Narration,Cuts to Stan putting a book calledWhy Am I Sweaty?on his desk
Carpet Diem,Mabel,I—I should really be goin—
Carpet Diem,Stan,"No way out of it!(Pulls Mabel on his lap and opens the book)Look. It all begins with this little fella. The pituitary gland. He may be little, but he has BIG PLANS."
Carpet Diem,Mabel,(Screams)
Carpet Diem,Narration,Cuts to Soos walking through the town in Waddles' body.
Carpet Diem,Soos,I wonder what frolicking adventures I'll stumble into.(Stops in front of a mud puddle)A mud puddle! Do I dare live out the cliche?(Jumps into the puddle)Ha ha ha ha ha!
Carpet Diem,Old Man McGucket,"(Walks down the street)McGucket, McGucket, McGucket, wow!(Looks at Soos)"
Carpet Diem,Soos,"I'm a pig! Oink oink, right?"
Carpet Diem,Old Man McGucket,Free meal...(Pulls a knife and a fork out of his beard)
Carpet Diem,Soos,No! Don't eat me! I'm a man trapped in a pig's body!
Carpet Diem,Old Man McGucket,That's what they all say...(Chases Soos)
Carpet Diem,Soos,(Runs away)Help! Police!

Carpet Diem,Blubs,"Yeah, of course I knew!"
Carpet Diem,Narration,"Cuts to Stan closing the ""Why Am I Sweaty?"" book."
Carpet Diem,Stan,And now you know where babies come from!
Carpet Diem,Mabel,(Whispers)Goodbye childhood...
Carpet Diem,Stan,"You know, I find you more likable today than usual. Maybe you could still win that game after all."
Carpet Diem,Mabel,Huh?
Carpet Diem,Stan,I was gonna give that new room to Mabel—
Carpet Diem,Mabel,"No, you should! Give it to Mabel... you. big. jerk!"
Carpet Diem,Stan,What did you say to me?
Carpet Diem,Mabel,"I said, uh, shut up old man! You're fat and dumb and you're a dummy and, take that!(Lightly punches Stan on the arm)"
Carpet Diem,Stan,"(Glares at Mabel)Finally ""Stan'n"" up to me, huh? Ha ha! I love it! You know, I made up my mind!(Takes out the key)The room belongs to you. Dipper."
Carpet Diem,Mabel,You can't! You have to give it to Mabel!
Carpet Diem,Stan,"Ssh.(Hugs Mabel)You had me at ""shut up old man."""

Carpet Diem,Dipper,NOOOOOOOOOOO!
Carpet Diem,McGucket,I'm gonna make you into bacon...
Carpet Diem,Soos,"Hey, that sounds pretty good! Wait, I mean,NOOOOOOOOOOO!"
Carpet Diem,Narration,"Cuts to Grenda tossing dice and moving a piece on ""Calling All Boys: Preteen Edition."""
Carpet Diem,Grenda,"3, 4, 5."
Carpet Diem,Narration,The phone in the middle of the game rings
Carpet Diem,Grenda,It's him! My dream date!(Picks up phone)Hello?
Carpet Diem,Robotic Voice,"Hello baby, this is Kevin. My beach house has room for 2."
Carpet Diem,Candy,Kevin has the voice of a robot.
Carpet Diem,Grenda,"Don't ruin this for me, Candy!(Hangs up)It's your turn, Mabel.(Looks up but Dipper is not there)"
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"(Runs down the hallway)Gotta win the room. Stan! It's me, Mabel! I'm doing things you hate!(Flips over a table)"
Carpet Diem,Narration,The lamp on the table rolls over at Mabel's feet
Carpet Diem,Mabel,"(Sighs)It's over, Dipper. Stan gave you the room.(Opens her hand up and reveals the key)"
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"Ha ha! Yes! Alright!(Raises her hand and leg in the air in a girly fashion, but he realizes it, and lowers them awkwardly)Well, let's switch bodies then and I can start moving in."
Carpet Diem,Mabel,Wait a minute. You can't have the room... if you can never get in!(Runs off)
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"Hey, come back!(Runs after her)"
Carpet Diem,Mabel,(Runs into the room and closes the door)
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"Come on!(Bangs on the door)Arrgh! Open the door, Dipper! I mean, Mabel.(Face palms and sits down)How am I ever gonna get in there?(Gets an idea)Hmm..."
Carpet Diem,Narration,Cuts to Candy and Grenda playing the game still.
Carpet Diem,Candy,"(On the phone)Kevin, for the last time, I am not interested!(Hangs up)"
Carpet Diem,Grenda,How could you say that to Kevin?
Carpet Diem,Dipper,Hey girls... who wants to give my brother a makeover?
Carpet Diem,Candy and Grenda,(Gasp and grin)
Carpet Diem,Narration,Cuts to Waddles walking around in the gift shop
Carpet Diem,Waddles,"(Walks around the gift shop, knocking over things until finding a tissue box and begins eating the tissues)"
Carpet Diem,Stan,"(Walks in)Oh good, Soos."
Carpet Diem,Waddles,(Turns around with a tissue still in his mouth)
Carpet Diem,Stan,You got a second?
Carpet Diem,Waddles,(Sucks in the tissue)
Carpet Diem,Stan,"Look, times are tough, economy or something, et cetera. Basically, I have to cut your pay."
Carpet Diem,Waddles,(Raises hand and touches Stan's nose)
Carpet Diem,Stan,Wha—what are you doing?
Carpet Diem,Waddles,(Begins breathing and snorting loudly)
Carpet Diem,Stan,Is this some sort of negotiating tactic? Because it's not gonna work!
Carpet Diem,Waddles,(Continues breathing and snorting loudly)
Carpet Diem,Stan,Uh... Fine! I was lying! I'll give you a raise! Just never do that again! Uh! Nightmare!
Carpet Diem,Narration,A lady walks in to the Shack.
Carpet Diem,Bandana lady,Can you help me? I'm looking for directions.
Carpet Diem,Waddles,(Looks outside the window and heads outside)
Carpet Diem,Bandana lady,"Oh, you'll show me the way? Such a gentleman!"
Carpet Diem,Narration,"Cuts to Mabel sitting on the ground writing on a sign that says ""NOBOYS, NO GIRLS, NO BOYSALLOWED"""
Carpet Diem,Candy and Grenda,(Knock on the door)It's Candy and Grenda!
Carpet Diem,Mabel,"Friends!(Opens door)Hey guys, what's up?"
Carpet Diem,Dipper,(Walks up behind Candy and Grenda)
Carpet Diem,Mabel,Dipper! Wa—wait! Don't let him in here—
Carpet Diem,Candy and Grenda,Makeovers!(Come in and bring in a box full of cosmetics supplies)
Carpet Diem,Mabel,"No no, wait stop!"
Carpet Diem,Narration,"Mabel slips on her piece of paper and Candy and Grenda begin putting on blush, lipstick and mascara."
Carpet Diem,Grenda,We're gonna make you SOO hot!
Carpet Diem,Mabel,"No! Wait! Stop! Guys, you have to listen to me!"
Carpet Diem,Grenda,(Puts more blush on Mabel)
Carpet Diem,Mabel,No!
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"Good job ladies. Now let me just add one...(starts walking over, building up electricity)...final...(raises hand)...touch..."
Carpet Diem,Narration,"Dipper touches Mabel's nose causing the atoms to swap electrons again, switching their bodies back."
Carpet Diem,Candy,Oh oh.
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"Ah my body.(Takes out the key)I'm a genius, ha ha! Ugh.(Wipes off the makeup)Alright, Mabel. The room is mine!"
Carpet Diem,Grenda,"Wait, hold on here. What just happened?"
Carpet Diem,Mabel,"(Sigh)I barely understand it. All I know is that if you shuffle your feet on this carpet, you can switch bodies or whatever."
Carpet Diem,Candy,"(Gets up and begins to shuffle feet)Zip, zap."
Carpet Diem,Dipper,No!
Carpet Diem,Narration,"Candy touches Dipper's nose, switching the electrons and switching bodies."
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"Aw, come on!(Takes back the key)"
Carpet Diem,Candy,"I am a boy now!(In a deep voice:)Wassup, bro. Let's grow some mustaches."
Carpet Diem,Mabel,"Dipper, give me that key back!(Run up to Dipper and tries to get the key)"
Carpet Diem,Grenda,Guys stop fighting!(Tries to pull them apart)
Carpet Diem,Narration,"The 3 built up electricity and they swap bodies, so that Dipper is in Grenda's, Mabel is in Candy's and Grenda's is in Mabel's."
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"Oh no! Then again, I like having muscles for once."
Carpet Diem,Grenda,"Wow, now I have tiny little doll hands!"
Carpet Diem,Mabel,"Everybody look. Swap back in(Everyone starts building up electricity)3, 2..."
Carpet Diem,Soos,Oh dudes!
Carpet Diem,McGucket,Come back! I wanna deep fry your ears!
Carpet Diem,Narration,Everyone in the room switches bodies; they start yelling.
Carpet Diem,Group,"Hey, no! Give me my body back!... ow ow(Electric zapping noises)"
Carpet Diem,Narration,Cut to Grunkle Stan polishingFord'sold pair of glasses and watching baby fights.
Carpet Diem,TV,Tonight on Baby Fights! Tensions rise between Maddison and Avery at Baby Fights Headquarters.
Carpet Diem,Baby,(Subtitles)I didn't come here to make friends.
Carpet Diem,Narration,The yells from the other room distract him so he turns up the volume on the TV.
Carpet Diem,Grenda,(In McGucket's body)Cool! I'm Santa Claus.
Carpet Diem,McGucket,(In Candy's body)WOOEE! Haha! I've regained my innocence!
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"(In Waddles' body; sighs)Well, I guess I'm a pig now, so, that's a thing(grabs apple)Om nom nom."
Carpet Diem,Soos,(In Grenda's body)This body's not that different from my old one.
Carpet Diem,Sheriff Blubs,We've got some reports of excessive gigglin'.
Carpet Diem,Narration,"Candy and Grenda in Dipper and McGucket's bodies laugh and run into each other, causing them to swap bodies with Blubs and Durland."
Carpet Diem,Blubs,My horoscope didn't say anything about this.
Carpet Diem,Durland,AHH! What's happenin' to me?!(Runs into wall)Ow!(runs into wall again)Ooh!(starts giggling)
Carpet Diem,Candy,(In Blub's body; admiring herself in the mirror)I am a police officer now!(Giggles)
Carpet Diem,Grenda,"Let's go bust some perps, Candy!"
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"(Still a pig)Give me that key, Mabel!(lunges at Mabel)"
Carpet Diem,Mabel,(In her own body)Never!(they bump into people several times and switch bodies)
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"(In his own body)Mabel, are you you?"
Carpet Diem,Mabel,"Yeah, I'm me."
Carpet Diem,Dipper,Well I've got the key!
Carpet Diem,Narration,Mabel chases Dipper up to the attic and they fight over the key.
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"Mabel, the room is mine! Give it to me!(Tackles Mabel)"
Carpet Diem,Mabel,What's with you? Why do you need that room so bad? I never even wanted to move out!
Carpet Diem,Dipper,Me either!
Carpet Diem,Mabel,"Wait, what? Say that again?"
Carpet Diem,Dipper,I—I never wanted to move out.
Carpet Diem,Mabel,Then whatwasall this?
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"Everything was fine until you started bringing your friends around every night. I mean, hanging out with you this summer's been fun. But, now you're always with Candy and Grenda, and I'm... like... just, left behind."
Carpet Diem,Mabel,"Aww, Dipper."
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"It's okay. I've just been having a hard time, you wouldn't understand what I'm going through."
Carpet Diem,Mabel,"You're probably feeling awkward and sweaty, huh?"
Carpet Diem,Dipper,Yeah. How'd you know?
Carpet Diem,Mabel,Here. I won't fight you for it.(Tosses Dipper the key)
Carpet Diem,Dipper,Thanks.
Carpet Diem,Mabel,"(Later in the hidden room)Well it looks like everyone's back to normal... Except for Soos, who may be a pig permanently...?"
Carpet Diem,Soos,"(Chewing on door frame)Oh no, I changed back. At least I think I did."
Carpet Diem,McGucket,(Comes up from behind Soos with fork and knife)I'll still eat ya.
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"Okay, pal, that's enough of that, move it along.(he and Mabel push McGucket out the door)"
Carpet Diem,Mabel,"Move it along, weird old man."
Carpet Diem,Narration,Waddles walks under Soos' leg.
Carpet Diem,Soos,"I guess being a pig wasn't that great after all. Hey, let me get that spot you can never reach."
Carpet Diem,Narration,"Waddles grunts, doorbell rings. Soos answers door."
Carpet Diem,Bandana lady,"Hey, I've been thinking, and the answer is yes, I will marry you!"
Carpet Diem,Soos,"Wait, I don't remember anything about—(woman kisses him)Oh—alright."
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"(Moving into the new room)Ah, there."
Carpet Diem,Stan,"Ah, a man and his own space."
Carpet Diem,Dipper,That's right. Finally.
Carpet Diem,Stan,(Points to carpet)So what are you gonna do with this old thing?
Carpet Diem,Dipper,Get rid of it.
Carpet Diem,Stan,"(Smiles nervously)Haha! You got it.(Picks up carpet and leave room)Yeesh, this carpet's ugly."
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"(Gets into bed)Ah. Finally, my own room. Good night Mabel.(Looks to the left, remembers that she's still in the attic)"
Carpet Diem,Mabel,"(In the attic)Good night Dipper.(Looks to right, remembers that he's in the new room, and turns over)"
Carpet Diem,Narration,Someone knocks on door; Mabel gets up and answers.
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"Hey, um. Do you want to have a sleepover?"
Carpet Diem,Mabel,(Smiles)FORE!(Swings a golf club)
Carpet Diem,Narration,Dipper laughs and hits the ball. It crashes outside the window again.
Carpet Diem,Stan,(Off-screen)Ahh! Why am I even out here at night?
Carpet Diem,Narration,Mabel and Dipper laugh.
Carpet Diem,Narration,Cuts to credits.
Carpet Diem,Mabel,So what are you gonna do with that new room?
Carpet Diem,Dipper,"I gave it to Soos to replace that horrible break room he has. Hey, do you know what the deal was with that lady?"
Carpet Diem,Narration,Mabel shrugs.
Carpet Diem,Bandana lady,"(In other room, crying)I just don't think I can do this anymore, you just seem so different.(Cries)"
Carpet Diem,Soos,"Look dude, I'm playing a little bit of catch up here, I was in a pig's body for most of the day, wha, what's goin' on?"
Carpet Diem,Narration,Lady looks at him.
Carpet Diem,Soos,"Can we kiss again, i—is that an option?"
Carpet Diem,Soos (off-screen),"(The Disney logo appears)Ow, wait wait."
Boyz Crazy,Narration,The episode opens with a close up of the Gift Shop's security feed ofStantalking to acustomer.WendyandDippervoice over what they say.
Boyz Crazy,Dipper Pines,(As tourist:) Do you have this T-shirt in my size?
Boyz Crazy,Wendy Corduroy,(As Stan:) I have something even better! Behold: My butt!
Boyz Crazy,Narration,"Dipper and Wendy laugh, the latter is holding a packet ofchips."
Boyz Crazy,Dipper,(Whispers)I could play this game forever.
Boyz Crazy,Wendy,What'd you say?
Boyz Crazy,Dipper,Coughing! I was coughing! Those weren't words!
Boyz Crazy,Mabel Pines,"(Laughs)This is fun, what you two have."
Boyz Crazy,Dipper,Mabel? How long have you been standing there?
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,Don't worry about that. Let's talk about why I'm doing this dance! Do-do-do-do-do...
Boyz Crazy,Dipper,"Oh, no! She got into theSmile Dipagain!"
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,Wrong one-thousand! It's because today is the greatest day of my life!
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Mabel throws a calendar at Dipper's face.
Boyz Crazy,Dipper,Ow!
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,Sev'ral Timezis playing at theGravity Falls Civic Center and Buffet!
Boyz Crazy,Dipper,Ugh. Sev'ral Timez? Aren't they that boy band that came a decade too late?
Boyz Crazy,Narration,"Cut to a music video of Sev'ral Timez performing ""Cray Cray."""
Boyz Crazy,Sev'ral Timez,"Oh oh ooh, Girl, you got me ackin' so cray cray/CRAY CRAY/You tell me that you won't be my ba-bay/We're not threatening!"
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Cut back to the present. Mabel is standing posed with her arms crossed.
Boyz Crazy,Dipper,"Mabel, you know all those boy bands are fake, right?"
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Mabel has started dancing.
Boyz Crazy,Wendy,Dipper's right. They're just a manufactured product of the bloated corporate music industry.
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,You're making my dance sad...
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Mabel stops dancing.
Boyz Crazy,Dipper,(Snorts)There's probably a machine that mass-produces them.
Boyz Crazy,Wendy,"Oh ho, or maybe the boys are grown from pods."
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Dipper and Wendy burst into laughter.
Boyz Crazy,Dipper,"Yeah, pods, totally!"
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,You guys can't ruin this for me. Mabel's got back up!
Boyz Crazy,Narration,GrendaandCandyenter the shop.
Boyz Crazy,Grenda Grendinator,Hey guys!
Boyz Crazy,Candy Chiu,Woot-woot!
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,Who's ready for the greatest night of our lives? How many times am I gonna love ya?
Boyz Crazy,"Mabel, Grenda, & Candy",Sev'ral times!
Boyz Crazy,Narration,The three laugh and run off screen.
Boyz Crazy,Dipper,Ugh. Girls.
Boyz Crazy,Wendy,"I know, right?"
Boyz Crazy,Narration,"Mabel and Grenda run through the ""Employees Only"" door. Candy runs right into thevending machineand smashes her glasses."
Boyz Crazy,Candy,I'm okay!(goes through the door)
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Cut to thetheme song.
Boyz Crazy,Narration,In the attic. Mabel and her friends are getting ready for the concert.
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,Should I go with lip balm or lip salve?
Boyz Crazy,Grenda,(Putting on make-up)Go wild! Tonight's our night!
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,"I can't wait guys. Tonight we're gonna meet Creggy G, Greggy C, Leggy P, Chubby Z and Deep Chris!"
Boyz Crazy,Candy,He's the phat one!
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,And those boys will fall in love with us.
Boyz Crazy,Grenda,Why wouldn't they?(Stuffs mouth with peanut butter)
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Cut back to Dipper and Wendy in the gift shop. Through the security feed we seeRobbiewalk into the shop.
Boyz Crazy,Dipper,"(As Robbie:) Hey, is this the fingerless glove store? I like things that are dumb. I'm Robbie."
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Dipper and Wendy laugh.
Boyz Crazy,Wendy,C'mon man...
Boyz Crazy,Robbie,"Ha ha ha ha ha. Laugh it up, chief. So hey, Wendy,Nateand his girlfriend are going toLookout Pointthis weekend. Maybe we should go too?"
Boyz Crazy,Wendy,"(Angered)Are you kidding me?!First you stand me up last night! And instead of apologizing, you want me to go to Lookout Point?!"
Boyz Crazy,Dipper,I'll just be... over here...
Boyz Crazy,Narration,"Dipper backs out of the room to the ""Employees Only"" door and eavesdrops on their conversation from there."
Boyz Crazy,Wendy,"Look, Robbie...(sighs)I'm not sure this relationship's working. Maybe I should see other people."
Boyz Crazy,Narration,"Dipper, ecstatic, drops to his knees and raises his fists up."
Boyz Crazy,Dipper,Yes!(grabsWaddleswho was sitting behind him and hugs the pig tightly)
Boyz Crazy,Robbie,"W-Whoa h-hey! Before you do anything crazy, I- I uh... I want you to hear this."
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Robbie reaches into his pocket and pulls out a CD from a suspicious looking case.
Boyz Crazy,Robbie,I hope this works...
Boyz Crazy,Narration,"He pulls the CD close to his face, and it glistens. He smirks while his eyes shoot to Wendy behind him. Dipper, still peeking in, raises an eyebrow. Robbie puts the CD in a player."
Boyz Crazy,Robbie,I wrote this song just for you...
Boyz Crazy,Narration,He presses play and begins singing asong.
Boyz Crazy,Robbie,When I think about you/I feel feelings so deep/I'm tossing and turning/And you know I'm losing sleep
Boyz Crazy,Dipper,Yeesh.
Boyz Crazy,Robbie,And I know I'm going crazy/When I look into your eyes/Just listen to this song/And you'll be hypnotai-ai-ai-zed
Boyz Crazy,Narration,"As Robbie sings the final words of the song, the camera zooms in on a wide-eyed Wendy."
Boyz Crazy,Wendy,"(Rubs her eyes)Y'know, maybe I was being a little hasty. I'll give you another chance."
Boyz Crazy,Robbie,"Yes, alright!"
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Wendy kisses Robbie on the cheek much to Dipper's shock.
Boyz Crazy,Wendy,Mwah. Let me go grab my coat.
Boyz Crazy,Narration,"Wendy leaves through the ""Employees Only"" door."
Boyz Crazy,Dipper,"Alright Robbie, I saw that weird CD. What the heck are you up to?"
Boyz Crazy,Robbie,"It's called romance, kid. Something you'd never understand."
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Dipper growls angrily. Wendy comes back.
Boyz Crazy,Wendy,You ready? I can't believe you wrote that for me.
Boyz Crazy,Robbie,"I know, I'm just so insanely talented."
Boyz Crazy,Narration,"Robbie and Wendy leave and as they do so, Robbie briefly taunts Dipper behind her back. Dipper is left alone still shocked, before he turns to the CD player and pulls out the CD Robbie left behind."
Boyz Crazy,Dipper,Hm...
Boyz Crazy,Narration,"Dipper inspects the CD, sniffs it, and licks it."
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,What are you doing?
Boyz Crazy,Narration,"The camera cuts back to show Mabel, Grenda, and Candy staring at Dipper, baffled."
Boyz Crazy,Dipper,"Guys, the weirdest thing just happened. I think Robbie might be hypnotizing Wendy with his music."
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,"Oh, Dipper. Girls just like musicians. You'll understand when you're older."
Boyz Crazy,Dipper,We're the same age!
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,"Girls mature faster than guys. Right, Grenda?"
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Grenda is furiously kissing a magazine photo of Chubby Z.
Boyz Crazy,Grenda,This is Grenda time!
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Dipper stares blankly at her. The scene cuts to the outside of the Gravity Falls Civic Center and Buffet where the girls stand around excitedly.
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,"Ok, girls have you all practiced your obsessed boy band scream?"
Boyz Crazy,Grenda,Ahhh!
Boyz Crazy,Candy,Ahhh!
Boyz Crazy,Old Man McGucket,(Runs up behind the three)Ahhhhh!
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,...Just gonna ignore that.
Boyz Crazy,Narration,The girls run up to the box office excitedly.
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,Tickets please!
Boyz Crazy,Ticket seller,"Too late, girls! The show's sold out."
Boyz Crazy,Narration,"The ticket seller closes the shutters of the box office with a nasty smile. The girls gasp and look around at all the ""Sold out"" signs hanging all over the area. They shuffle off to the front of a large ""Sev'ral Timez"" poster that's marked by a large ""Sold out"" banner."
Boyz Crazy,Grenda,This night is ruined.
Boyz Crazy,Candy,(Collapses face down on ground)I welcome you death.
Boyz Crazy,Narration,"Mabel looks at the two sadly, before shooting up to her feet with determination."
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,"No! I said we were going to meet Sev'ral Timez tonight, and I meant it! And I'm not going to let a ""Keep out"" sign, keep us out!"
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Cut to the kitchen in theMystery Shack.
Boyz Crazy,Stan (singing),"Stockin' meat for the apocalypse, doodly-doo. We're all gonna die."
Boyz Crazy,Narration,"Dipper walks in, staring down at the CD he's holding and paces up and down the kitchen."
Boyz Crazy,Stan,"What's with the pacing, kid? You look even more freaked out than usual."
Boyz Crazy,Dipper,"Um, I dunno... You wouldn't understand."
Boyz Crazy,Stan,"Aw, c'mon kid.(Stan pulls Dipper into a chair)Try me."
Boyz Crazy,Dipper,"Okay. This is gonna sound weird, but I think Robbie might be brainwashing Wendy with music."
Boyz Crazy,Stan,I've seen this before.
Boyz Crazy,Dipper,Really?
Boyz Crazy,Stan,"Her name wasCarla McCorkle. Carla ""Hotpants"" McCorkle."
Boyz Crazy,Narration,"Stan turns his head and the shot fades to a young Stan Pines leaning against a juke box, nodding his head to the music."
Boyz Crazy,Stan (Narrating),"Me and Carla baby would cut a rug together atThe Juke Joint, our favorite 50's themed, 1970's diner."
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Young Stan and Carla embrace before the two start dancing happily together.
Boyz Crazy,Stan (Narrating),"Then one day, this new age tree hugger starts playing this transcendental hippie music."
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Young Stan dances by himself and turns to see Carla andThistle Downeholding each other. He stares at them in shock.
Boyz Crazy,Stan (Narrating),(Sighs)Carla's hotpants turned into bellbottoms before I even knew what happened.
Boyz Crazy,Narration,"The camera pans down the new couple and Carla's hotpants literally turn into bellbottoms. They then shoot up out of screen, leaving behind a trail of rainbows and sparkles. Young Stan looks down forlorn and it fades back to current Stan still looking sad."
Boyz Crazy,Stan,"My memories get a little hallucination-y at the end, but you get the gist."
Boyz Crazy,Dipper,"So, wait... you actually believe my theory?"
Boyz Crazy,Stan,You're darn right I do. And we're gonna get to the bottom of it.
Boyz Crazy,Narration,"Dipper smiles, encouraged."
Boyz Crazy,Stan,Right after I get to the bottom of this brown meat.
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Stan upturns the can of meat he was holding and hits the back of the can so the meat falls in his mouth.
Boyz Crazy,Stan,"Om, nom, it's apocolicious!"
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Cut to the Sev'ral Timez concert which is coming to an end. The band is dancing on stage.
Boyz Crazy,Sev'ral Timez,Sev'ral Timez!
Boyz Crazy,Narration,The crowd screams. Deep Chris is sitting on a stool holding a mike.
Boyz Crazy,Deep Chris,"Hey, girl. I just wanna get real for a moment. And say that while we love being superstars, the real reason we do this... is for you. For you specifically. Not the girl sitting next to you. Butyou."
Boyz Crazy,Brunette ofPacifica's friends,I love you Deep Chris!
Boyz Crazy,Redhead of Pacifica's friends,He was talking to me!
Boyz Crazy,Narration,The redhead throws a chair at the brunette and soon a whole crowd jumps into fighting.
Boyz Crazy,Tyler Cutebiker,Get 'em! Get 'em!
Boyz Crazy,Creggy G.,"Thank you, good night!"
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Cuts to a bunch of girls screaming as they leave the concert past the back stage door of the Civic Center. The door's lock has been picked with a hair clip.
Boyz Crazy,Grenda,Hello! Sev'ral Timez?
Boyz Crazy,Candy,We want to give you several kisses!
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,Look!(points)
Boyz Crazy,Narration,The three run up to Sev'ral Timez's dressing room door.
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,"This is it, girls. You're finally going to meet the five cutest boys in the world! Dipper's gonna eat his words that boy bands are ""fake.""(Takes deep breath and opens the door)"
Boyz Crazy,Narration,The girls gasp at the sight of several cloning tubes of the band in several stages of thier biological development. Starting with their current teenaged age to a fetus. The girls turn and see the band in a giant hamster cage.
Boyz Crazy,Chubby Z.,"Yo, we're clones, dawg!"
Boyz Crazy,Grenda,O.
Boyz Crazy,Candy,M.
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,G.
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,That is one big hamster tube.(Gasps)Someone's coming!
Boyz Crazy,Narration,The three hide behind a rack of clothes as a man walks in imposingly.
Boyz Crazy,Ergman Bratsman,"Terrible show! What is wrong with you boys? You barely even sold out the arena! And Deep Chris, you call that a pout?"
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Deep Chris pouts and whimpers like a puppy; his bottom lip trembling.
Boyz Crazy,Bratsman,"Every one of you should be ashamed of yourselves! Except you, Leggy P. You were really on point tonight. Here ya go, gorgeous."
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Bratsman throws Leggy P. a giant hamster treat. He nibbles on it and hisses when Deep Chris reaches for it.
Boyz Crazy,Bratsman,"As for the rest of you. Remember, you can always be replaced by yourbrothers."
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Bratsman indicates to the cloning tubes and the one that looks like a preteen dances at Bratsman's cue.
Boyz Crazy,Bratsman,"Dance for me child! DANCE!(Bratsman laughs and chokes maniacally)Augh, my throat is killin' me. Can someone get me a lemon water?"
Boyz Crazy,Narration,"He slams the door shut as he leaves, which forces the girls to fall out of their hiding place."
Boyz Crazy,Deep Chris,Who goes there? Prepare to be danced at!
Boyz Crazy,Narration,"Deep Chris starts dancing towards the edge of the cage where Mabel stares wide-eyed from the floor. Creggy G. crouches in front of Deep Chris, blocking him from Mabel."
Boyz Crazy,Creggy G.,"Step off, Deep Chris. She's a lady. Don't disrespect her, bro. Don't disrespect."
Boyz Crazy,Deep Chris,My bad.
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,(Squeals)
Boyz Crazy,Deep Chris,"Chubby Z., let's calm this boo-bop, posing for her poster style."
Boyz Crazy,Narration,The band pose for her.
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,(Lets out a small scream)Trying not to let my brain explode. I've always wanted to meet you guys! But what was the deal with that scary chub-chub man?
Boyz Crazy,Deep Chris,"Mr. Bratsman's our producer, yo."
Boyz Crazy,Creggy G.,"He genetically engineered us to be the perfect boy band, G."
Boyz Crazy,Chubby Z.,"But he keeps us in cages! That junk is straight brutal, girl!"
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,"That is straight brutal, Chubby Z."
Boyz Crazy,Creggy Z.,"Our one dream is to escape into thereal world. For real. Yo, I heard 'bout these things called ""trees."" I dunno what they are, but I wanna kiss one!"
Boyz Crazy,Greggy C.,But we can't disobey Mr. Bratsman. He says he loves us.
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,"If he loved you, he'd set you free!"
Boyz Crazy,Sev'ral Timez,"(Nodding)True dat, true dat."
Boyz Crazy,Chubby Z.,That's a valid perspective!
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,(Picks lock)Let's go right now. Me and my friends can help you escape!
Boyz Crazy,Grenda,We're masters of STEALTH!
Boyz Crazy,Chubby Z.,"Yo, you'd really do that for us, beef?"
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,"You can count on me!(Pause)I'm sorry, did you just call me ""beef""?"
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Cut back to the Mystery Shack.
Boyz Crazy,Stan,"Y'see, Dipper, music has sublimnal mind control hidden in it all the time. If you listen closely, even the music I play in the Gift Shop has subtle hidden messages."
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Cut to twotouristsbrowsing the gift shop.
Boyz Crazy,Speaker,BUY MORE KEYCHAINS! BUY MORE KEYCHAINS!
Boyz Crazy,Narration,"One tourist runs away after knocking down postcards. The other collapses onto the floor after dropping a jarred hand, and whimpers as he presses his hands over his ears. Cut back to Stan and Dipper."
Boyz Crazy,Stan,"If you wanna hear the mind controlling messages, you gotta slow down the record. Gimme that LP."
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Stan grabs the CD from Dipper and puts it on a record player. It just scratches the CD which discharges little sparks of electricity.
Boyz Crazy,Dipper,"Oh, right."
Boyz Crazy,Stan,"We're doin' something wrong here, but I can't put my finger on it..."
Boyz Crazy,Narration,"Mabel, Grenda, and Candy are shoving a large sports bag into the Shack. Mabel groans with the effort."
Boyz Crazy,Dipper,"Hey, guys. How was the concert, and what's in the bag?"
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,Uh... money! Money we stole!
Boyz Crazy,Candy,We are criminals! We will cut you!
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,Let's go away from here now!
Boyz Crazy,Narration,The girls pull and shove the bag up the stairs and the band members inside the bag yelp at every other step. Dipper and Stan watch them and look at each other questioningly.
Boyz Crazy,Narration,"Cut to the the inside of the bag getting unzipped. In Mabel and Dipper's room, the Sev'ral Timez members fall out one at a time. Deep Chris comes out in a pose."
Boyz Crazy,Leggy P.,"Your tour bus is really strange, Mabel girl. Where the feedin' tubes at?"
Boyz Crazy,Narration,The members inspect the room. Deep Chris pats Waddles on his head.
Boyz Crazy,Deep Chris,"Yo, what up, girl?(Waddles oinks)"
Boyz Crazy,Narration,The girls giggle and share secretive smiles with each other.
Boyz Crazy,Creggy G.,"So, when do we get to go outside?"
Boyz Crazy,Chubby Z.,I wanna cavort like a woodland creature!
Boyz Crazy,Narration,A car screeches outside. Mabel runs to the window.
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,(Gasps)It's your producer!
Boyz Crazy,Narration,"The band members panic and jump under Mabel's bed. Outside, Bratsman exits his limousine."
Boyz Crazy,Bratsman,I can't believe those boys escaped from their cage.(He turns to Soos)You there! I found this trail of frosted tips leading to thisvery location. Have you seen any perfect boys around here?
Boyz Crazy,Soos,"Only when I look in the mirror. Haha, up top!"
Boyz Crazy,Narration,"Soos raises his hand for a high five, but Bratsman just stares at him. Eventually, he high fives himself."
Boyz Crazy,Bratsman,They must be around here somewhere! I'll find those boys if I have to turn this town upside down!
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Gompersbleats as he chews off Bratsman's license plate.
Boyz Crazy,Bratsman,Shoo! Shoo! Ehh...
Boyz Crazy,Narration,"Bratsman enters his limousine and leaves, glaring at Soos suspiciously as he does so."
Boyz Crazy,Soos,(To Gompers)Good boy.
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,"Guys, it's not safe out there! Ergman's still looking for you!"
Boyz Crazy,Chubby Z.,What do we do?
Boyz Crazy,Deep Chris,Aw dang!
Boyz Crazy,Greggy C.,"I'm scared, Mabel!"
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,"Don't worry, guys. He has to give up eventually. Hey... in the meantime, you guys can stay here with us!"
Boyz Crazy,Narration,The band members exclaim happily.
Boyz Crazy,Chubby Z.,"Aw right, twenty-thirteen!"
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,"Girls, do you realize what's happening here? We have our very own pet boy band that we can do whatever we want with!"
Boyz Crazy,Candy,"Remember, eventually we will have to let them go. We have to promise not to get too attached to them. Right, Mabel? Mabel?"
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,All aboard the braid train! Braid braid!
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Candy and Grenda look at Mabel and Sev'ral Timez sitting in a line of braiding each other's hair a little worriedly.
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,What?
Boyz Crazy,Narration,"Cut to a montage of the girls hanging out with the band. Asongsung by Sev'ral Timez plays over it. The band performing for the girls in the living room and hiding on the ceiling when Stan nearly catches them, teaching them to drink water normally, the girls racing on the band members in a long hallway. The montage ends with a Sev'ral Timez group hug and Mabel. Grenda and Candy try to join in as well."
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,Just—oh— just a few more minutes.
Boyz Crazy,Grenda,But--
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,(Hisses)
Boyz Crazy,Narration,"Grenda and Candy look at each other, startled."
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Cut to Dipper and Stan in the living room. Dipper has just finished converting the CD to a record.
Boyz Crazy,Dipper,"Alright, it took all day, but I converted it to a record. And now, we can slow it down to see if the mind control message theory is correct. Prepare to have your mind blown."
Boyz Crazy,Stan,"Spit-take, here I come.(SipsPitt Cola)"
Boyz Crazy,Narration,"The record plays and Dipper slows it down, a tapeman at the ready to record any hidden messages."
Boyz Crazy,Stan,Hm... that's not spit worthy. What gives?
Boyz Crazy,Dipper,What? Is that it?
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Dipper messes with the speed to no avail.
Boyz Crazy,Dipper,Ugh! This was so stupid! Course there's no hidden mind control messages! Mabel was right. Wendy just likes the song. She just likes Robbie.
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Wendy and Robbie enter.
Boyz Crazy,Wendy,"Hey, Dip. Forgot my keys.(leaves)"
Boyz Crazy,Robbie,"What's up, junior? What are you doing? Trying to come up with an equation to make girls like you?(laughs)"
Boyz Crazy,Wendy,(enters)Ready to go to Lookout Point?
Boyz Crazy,Robbie,"Am I! Later, dorks. Catch ya on the rewind.(chuckles)I made that up."
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Robbie and Wendy leave.
Boyz Crazy,Stan,(shakes his fist)I'll rewind your face!
Boyz Crazy,Dipper,"Wait a minute. Stan, rewind!"
Boyz Crazy,Narration,"Dipper manually turns the record backwards and this time, another message can be heard."
Boyz Crazy,Record,You are now under my control. Your mind is mine.
Boyz Crazy,Stan,(spits soda onto Dipper's face)Holy mackerel! Now there's your spit-take!
Boyz Crazy,Dipper,"Ha ha! I knew it! It's mind control after all! Oh no, I've got to save Wendy!"
Boyz Crazy,Stan,"Finally, a good reason to punch a teenager in the face. Let's roll!"
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Dipper and Stan exit the back door. Mabel walks down the stairs and into the kitchen where Grenda and Candy are watching TV.
Boyz Crazy,Grenda,How'd it go up there?
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,"(sighs)Oh, I finally got them to sleep. Poor Greggy C. He tried to eat a tape dispenser."
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Cut to Greggy C.
Boyz Crazy,Greggy C.,"I think this is food, dog!(stuffs dispenser into mouth and starts choking on it.)"
Boyz Crazy,Creggy G.,"Yo, you gonna share that?"
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Cut back to the kitchen.
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,"Ah, memories."
Boyz Crazy,Shandra Jimenez(On TV),"The music industry was shaken today at the news that boy band king, Ergman Bratsman, has been arrested. He was pulled over tonight for not having a rear license plate."
Boyz Crazy,Bratsman,"I'm telling ya, the goat took it!"
Boyz Crazy,Sheriff Blubs,That's what they all say.
Boyz Crazy,Narration,He andDeputy Durlandraise their nightsticks to strike Bratsman before cutting back to the report.
Boyz Crazy,Shandra,"He is now in county jail, awaiting trial."
Boyz Crazy,Grenda,Yes!
Boyz Crazy,Candy,We have to tell the boys they are free now.
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,(laughs nervously)
Boyz Crazy,Candy,Let's go!
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Grenda and Candy giggle happily as they run up the stairs to the attic. Mabel runs to block them from the bedroom door.
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,Not so fast! They're not going anywhere.
Boyz Crazy,Grenda and Candy,(gasps)
Boyz Crazy,Grenda,"What's the dealio, Mabel? That evil producer is gone. We have to tell the boys."
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,"Wait, girls. Let's not be so hasty. I mean, think about it. If we don't tell the boys, then they can stay here with me—I mean, with us."
Boyz Crazy,Grenda,"Mabel, we can't keep them here forever."
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,But I love them!
Boyz Crazy,Candy,"If you loved them, you'd set them free."
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,Never! Every boy I've loved this summer has left me! And I'm not gonna let it happen again!
Boyz Crazy,Grenda,"Candy, we gotta get past Mabel. She's gone boy crazy!"
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,"(huffs, teeth bared) BOYS."
Boyz Crazy,Candy,"(growls)Candy, attack!"
Boyz Crazy,Narration,"Candy tackles Mabel through the door. The band stands up, startled."
Boyz Crazy,Grenda,"You guys, Ergman Bratsman is in jail! You're free!"
Boyz Crazy,Candy,Just go!
Boyz Crazy,Creggy G.,"Woah! Is that true, Mabel dog?"
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,"Uhh, no! Your producer's still out there! You're gonna have to stay here, probably forever!"
Boyz Crazy,Grenda,What! You can't listen to her!
Boyz Crazy,Deep Chris,"Mabel's our girl, girl. She puts pizza in our food trough!"
Boyz Crazy,Chubby Z.,"She changes my newspaper, yo. She's aight."
Boyz Crazy,Grenda,"She is not ""aight,"" Chubby Z!"
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Mabel pulls herself up from under Candy and marches up to the band members.
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,Sev'ral Timez!
Boyz Crazy,Sev'ral Timez,"Yes, Mabel dog?"
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,"Remove these two from the premises, please."
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Sev'ral Times moves toward Candy and Grenda while snapping their fingers at them.
Boyz Crazy,Grenda,"Oh no, they're aggressively dancing at us!"
Boyz Crazy,Narration,They pick up Candy and Grenda.
Boyz Crazy,Grenda,"Mabel's gone mad with power. Save yourselves, Sev'ral Timez! You were better off with your producer!"
Boyz Crazy,Narration,"They throw the two out the room, then turn and pose."
Boyz Crazy,Deep Chris,Word.
Boyz Crazy,Grenda,"(peeks her head back in)Call me, Deep Chris!(Leggy P. kicks the door back closed.)"
Boyz Crazy,Chubby Z.,Twenty-thirteen!
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,"(sighs)Thank you, boys. Now let's get aboard the braid train."
Boyz Crazy,Deep Chris,"Things just got pretty heavy, Mabel. Maybe we should just like, chill for a minute and--"
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,"I said, let's get aboard THE BRAID TRAIN!"
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Sev'ral Timez looks at each other worriedly.
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Cut to theStanmobiledriving quickly down a road.
Boyz Crazy,Dipper,We gotta warn Wendy about that song before she gets brainwashed!
Boyz Crazy,Stan,"Road safety laws, prepare to be ignored!(Stan drives through a blocked road)"
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Cut to Wendy and Robbie at Lookout Point.
Boyz Crazy,Robbie,"Huh, weird, Nate didn't show up. So I- I guess it's just you and me. This isn't what I was planning at all."
Boyz Crazy,Narration,The Stanmobile drives straight up the cliff edge to Lookout Point. Dipper runs out while Stan falls out.
Boyz Crazy,Stan,Wha-o! Oof.
Boyz Crazy,Dipper,Wendy!? Stop! Robbie's been lying to you!
Boyz Crazy,Wendy,Dipper?
Boyz Crazy,Robbie,Kid? Mr. Pines?
Boyz Crazy,Stan,That'sMr. Pinesto you!
Boyz Crazy,Robbie,What? That's what I just said...
Boyz Crazy,Dipper,"Look, Wendy, you've got to hear this."
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Cut to Mabel relaxing on bed drink chocolate milk. Sev'ral Timez walks up to her.
Boyz Crazy,Creggy G.,"Mabel, you've got to hear this. It's a song we wrote to say 'thank you.'"
Boyz Crazy,Greggy C.,Hit it!
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Thesongstarts to play to Mabel's delight.
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,"Oh, boy! Songs are like hugs that mouths give to ears!"
Boyz Crazy,Sev'ral Timez,"Here comes you/Mabel girl/We dreamed of being free, (so free)/But now we know/That that can never be/You know what friends are all about/You kicked those lying shorties out, (kick them out y'all)"
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,Starting to feel guilty here...
Boyz Crazy,Sev'ral Timez,"Break it down!/Who's the girl who's so aight/Tucks us into bed at night/Holds the fan up while we sing/Keeps me entertained with string!/My shirt was wrinkled till/SHE PRESSED IT/Chews our food/SO WE CAN DIGEST IT/He was evil, mean, and reckless/YOU GAVE ME THIS CANDY NECKLACE/'Sup, girl/Other folks we could never trust/But we know/That you'd never lie to us/Mabel girl/We know you love us SoOoOo"
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,And that's why I've got to let you go.(sighs)
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Cut back to Lookout Point. The tapeman is playing a regular recording of Robbie's song.
Boyz Crazy,Dipper,Uh... There's a message in there.(laughs nervously)I swear!
Boyz Crazy,Robbie,Let me just... close the window.
Boyz Crazy,Dipper,"Wait, wait! Here.(Raises the volume)"
Boyz Crazy,Recording,You are now under my control. Your mind is mine.
Boyz Crazy,Wendy,"Woah. Robbie, what's that doing in our song?"
Boyz Crazy,Robbie,"Baby, I promise. I don't know anything about those messages. In fact, I didn't even write that song. I ripped it off some other band! So, we're all good, right?"
Boyz Crazy,Wendy,"(Furious)No, we're not all good! I don't care about the messages. You said you wrote that song for me, and I actually thought it was sweet, you big liar."
Boyz Crazy,Robbie,"I know, I know. I lie about a lot of stuff. Like using your makeup and fighting a bear, although--"
Boyz Crazy,Wendy,"No! You know what? It's over, Robbie. We're through!"
Boyz Crazy,Robbie,What?! Wendy!
Boyz Crazy,Wendy,Goodbye!(Wendy gets out and slams thevandoor.)
Boyz Crazy,Stan,"Haha! We won! Kid, this is a victory for every guy whose hands are too weak or fat to play a musical instrument."
Boyz Crazy,Dipper,"I couldn't have done it without you, Grunkle Stan."
Boyz Crazy,Dipper and Stan,(high fives)Ha!
Boyz Crazy,Dipper,"(runs up to Wendy)Um, hey! Uh, now that your night is free, me and Grunkle Stan are thinking, maybe bowling, or something?"
Boyz Crazy,Wendy,(Crying and upset)Are you serious?! Right now? Ugh! What iswrongwith guys? You only think about yourselves! All of you should just leave me alone!(leaves)
Boyz Crazy,Robbie,"Oh, man.(buries his face into the steering wheel)"
Boyz Crazy,Stan,"Look, if it makes you feel any better, the apocalypse is coming soon. Bury your gold! ...You've been buying gold, right?"
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Dipper looks at his tape forlornly and ashamed.
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Cut to outside the Mystery Shack. Candy and Grenda walk up to the main entrance.
Boyz Crazy,Grenda,We've gotta save the boys.
Boyz Crazy,Candy,I'm prepared to defend myself.
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,"(opens door)Hi, guys. I'm sorry I went bonkers. A catchy song made me realize that you were right. Can you ever forgive me?"
Boyz Crazy,Grenda,Of course!
Boyz Crazy,Candy,"Friendship, repaired."
Boyz Crazy,Narration,The three hug. Sev'ral Timez exits the Shack.
Boyz Crazy,Leggy P.,"What's going on, Mabel girl?"
Boyz Crazy,Chubby Z.,You said you had something you wanted to show us or some deal?
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,Yup. This!(gestures to outside and the rising sun.)
Boyz Crazy,Narration,The band gasps to varying degrees.
Boyz Crazy,Chubby Z.,"Yo, dog who is this big, round, bright, fool?"
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,"That, Chubby Z., is the sun."
Boyz Crazy,Chubby Z.,That fool is makin' my eyes hurt straight painful! I'm gonna stare that fool down!(stares at the sun till his eyes water.)Aaauuugh!(rubs his eyes)
Boyz Crazy,Deep Chris,"Yo, yo, hold up. What's this big green mess?"
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,"That's nature, Deep Chris. Bratsman won't bother you anymore. You can do anything you wanna do, go anywhere you wanna go. You're free!"
Boyz Crazy,Chubby Z.,Fa-ree?
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,Free! You're free! It means you can skedaddle!(sobs and picks up a stick and hits their leg)Now go! Go!
Boyz Crazy,Narration,They hesitantly walk forward and turn to look back at Mabel.
Boyz Crazy,Mabel,Get out of here before I change my mind!
Boyz Crazy,Narration,They walk toward the bushes and sing a final refrain before disappearing into them.
Boyz Crazy,Sev'ral Timez,"(Singing)Goodbye, girl."
Boyz Crazy,Candy,They won't last a week.
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Cut to Stan and Dipper sitting in the living room.
Boyz Crazy,Stan,"Women. They're the real mystery, Dip. You ruin their date, drive their hippie boyfriend's van into a ravine... and somehow you're the ""bad guy."""
Boyz Crazy,Dipper,"No, it's my fault. I shouldn't have meddled in Wendy's personal life. She probably hates me now."
Boyz Crazy,Stan,"Ah, chin up, kid. You were tryin' to do the right thing. Even though you destroyed a relationship and part of my car."
Boyz Crazy,Dipper,You think she'll ever forgive me?
Boyz Crazy,Stan,"Ah, I bet she will. And until then, you can always go bowling with me."
Boyz Crazy,Dipper,"Thanks, Grunkle Stan."
Boyz Crazy,Stan,"Don't mention it, kid."
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Stan hears a gnawing sound coming from outside.
Boyz Crazy,Stan,Wait a second... Is something rooting through our trash?
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Outside Leggy P. is digging through a trashcan.
Boyz Crazy,Stan,"Hey, hey! Get outta here!"
Boyz Crazy,Narration,"Leggy P. scared, runs away on all fours."
Boyz Crazy,Stan,"Darn beautiful men, always eating out of my trash... Wait, what?"
Boyz Crazy,Narration,Credits roll.
Boyz Crazy,Sev'ral Timez,Girl you got me actin' so cray cray/CRAY CRAY/You tell me that you won't be my ba-bay/We're non-threatening girl/yeah
Boyz Crazy,Narration,They stop performing to what is revealed to be a deer. The deer leaps away.
Boyz Crazy,Creggy G.,(making out with a tree)Dang girl.(continues kissing)Twenty-thirteen.
Land Before Swine,Narration,"The episode begins with a car driving past a billboard withGideon'sface on it. Next to the billboard isDeputy DurlandandSheriff Blubs' squad car. The speed of the car diving by is 99 miles per hour (159.3 km/h), however, they are oblivious."
Land Before Swine,Sheriff Blubs,"Focus, Deputy. Remember your training. Easy...easy..."
Land Before Swine,Deputy Durland,(Trying a children's maze game)
Land Before Swine,Blubs,You're almost there!
Land Before Swine,Durland,(Somehow skips the treasure chest and lands into the mouth of the shark) Dang it! I almost got the treasure!
Land Before Swine,Blubs,"The time we spend together is treasure enough. (A rumbling starts) Hey, you feel that?"
Land Before Swine,Narration,Huge claws tear through and rip the roof off the car
Land Before Swine,Durland,Reckon we should report that?
Land Before Swine,Blubs,Or go for a ride in our new convertible!
Land Before Swine,Durland,Whoooooooooo!
Land Before Swine,Blubs,Yeaaaaaah!
Land Before Swine,Narration,They drive away while a roar is heard and aPterodactylflies past the moon
Land Before Swine,Narration,Cuts totheme song
Land Before Swine,Narration,Cuts toStangiving a tour on theMystery Cart
Land Before Swine,Stan Pines,"Ladies and gentlemen! Continuing our Mystery Tour, you'll see the world famous Outhouse of Mystery! I got stuck in there once!"
Land Before Swine,Boy,Could I go to the bathroom?
Land Before Swine,Stan,Save all questions until after the tour.
Land Before Swine,Boy,(sighs) (The cart drives over a bump) (The boy looks down and sighs again)
Land Before Swine,Stan,"And up ahead if you look really closely, everybody get your cameras, you're gonna wanna see this."
Land Before Swine,Narration,Cuts toMabelandWaddleslooking out the window
Land Before Swine,Mabel Pines,"Finally, Waddles, we have the whole house to ourselves! What do you think? Dance party?"
Land Before Swine,Waddles,(oinks)
Land Before Swine,Mabel,I'm not hearing a no!
Land Before Swine,Narration,"Mabel flips the sign from open to closed, turns on the volume of the radio, and the words ""PIG DANCE PARTY"" appear. Mabel dances by herself and with Waddles. They eat popsicles off the floor, Mabel squishes Waddles' face, they wear sunglasses and take pictures, eat books, and dance on the floor and table."
Land Before Swine,Mabel,"Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes...yes.....yes. (falls on the ground and Waddles licks her fingers) Uh oh! Cuddle time! (Waddles comes over and cuddles with her) Waddles, can I tell you a secret? You're my favorite pig in the whole world. (yawns and falls asleep)"
Land Before Swine,Stan,"(Walks in, counting money) Heh heh. (trips over Mabel) Aah! Mabel? What are ya doing on the floor?"
Land Before Swine,Mabel,Being cute and great! (squishes her and Waddles' faces together)
Land Before Swine,Stan,(Puts glasses on) And I thought your brother was weird.
Land Before Swine,Mabel,No. He's more like (puts on one of the hats Dipper wears and tries to mock his voice) Aaah! Let's solve a mystery! I kiss a pillow withWendy'sface drawn on it!
Land Before Swine,Stan,Ha ha ha. That's pretty good. Kissin' a pillow.
Land Before Swine,Waddles,(Starts chewing on Stan's pants)
Land Before Swine,Mabel,"Go, go! Chew that pant leg!"
Land Before Swine,Stan,Ugh! (Raises his leg and Waddles tears off a piece of his pants) Alright! (opens window) Outside! Now!
Land Before Swine,Mabel,No! Grunkle Stan! It's not safe for Waddles outside! There's predators! And barbecuers!
Land Before Swine,Stan,That's just the natural order! It's not my fault your pig's potentially delicious!
Land Before Swine,Mabel,He should be inside like a person.
Land Before Swine,Stan,People don't roll around in their own filth. Except for Soos.
Land Before Swine,Mabel,And we're the lesser for it. Maybe we're the ones who should be put outside. Huh? Huh? Think about it! Hmph! (walks out of the gift shop)
Land Before Swine,Narration,"Cuts to Dipper and Soos in the forest, sitting onSoos's truck"
Land Before Swine,Dipper Pines,"Today's the day,Soos. Thanks for coming along on this mission."
Land Before Swine,Soos Ramirez,"(Sweats like crazy) Dude, it's an honor. Today I'm sweating from heat and excitement! Hoo! (wipes off sweat)"
Land Before Swine,Dipper,"There's something hiding in these woods. Something big enough to rip the roof off a car. If we get a photo of this thing, we'll be heroes!"
Land Before Swine,Soos,Yeah we'll get all the babes. You'll be fending off smooches with a stick! (nudges Dipper)
Land Before Swine,Dipper,"Ha ha, shut up, man. (nudges Soos)"
Land Before Swine,Soos,"With a stick, dude!"
Land Before Swine,Dipper,"Here, give me a boost."
Land Before Swine,Narration,Cuts to Soos and Dipper tying 3 cameras to 3 trees. Soos slides down to a branch where Dipper is drinkingPitt Cola
Land Before Swine,Soos,Oof! Got it. (slides down) Is sap supposed to be this sticky? (tries to get it off)
Land Before Swine,Narration,Shows a fly trapped in the sap
Land Before Swine,Dipper,"If everything goes according to plan, the creature will grab that steak, cross through the string, and set off cameras A, B, and C."
Land Before Swine,Soos,And nothing can go wrong. High five!
Land Before Swine,Narration,"Soos and Dipper high five, but they get stuck"
Land Before Swine,Dipper,This was poorly planned...
Land Before Swine,Narration,"A roar is heard, a wind rushes through, and the cameras take pictures rapidly. Soos and Dipper look at it and the steak is gone, and the ropes are broken. Dipper and Soos give each other a huge smile"
Land Before Swine,Narration,Cuts to Mabel making Waddles a red sweater with her face on it
Land Before Swine,TV,Hey you!
Land Before Swine,Mabel,Me? (looks at the TV)
Land Before Swine,TV,Sick of constantly dropping your baby?
Land Before Swine,Man on TV,Yes.
Land Before Swine,Bobby Renzobbi,"Hi, I'm Bobby Renzobbi! And what you need is theHuggy Wuvvy Tummy Bundle!"
Land Before Swine,Man on TV,I can hold ten babies at once!
Land Before Swine,Bobby,"I know what you're thinking: Does it work for pigs? Ah ha ha, yeah it does work for pigs, stupid! Feel your pig's heartbeat next to yours! IT WORKS FOR PIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGS!!! (A giant pig nose comes on screen and oinks loudly)"
Land Before Swine,Mabel,(Gasp) Grunkle Stan! I'm off to get a Huggy Wuvvy Tummy Bundle!
Land Before Swine,Stan,Yeesh. Isn't knitting matching sweaters for that pig enough?
Land Before Swine,Mabel,"(Pauses) Nope. Anyway, (picks up Waddles) I need you to look after this little gentleman while I'm gone."
Land Before Swine,Waddles,(Eats a fly)
Land Before Swine,Stan,"Not now, kid, I got sometouristscoming through."
Land Before Swine,Mabel,"Grunkle Stan, I know you're not crazy about Waddles."
Land Before Swine,Stan,"He's a fat, naked, jerk."
Land Before Swine,Mabel,But you do care about me. Promise me you won't let him outside. (Tilts head and smiles)
Land Before Swine,Stan,"Fine, yeah yeah, I promise."
Land Before Swine,Mabel,Thanks Grunkle Stan! (runs out of the house)
Land Before Swine,Stan,"I'm watching you, pig. (Points at Waddles)"
Land Before Swine,Waddles,(Touches Stan's finger)
Land Before Swine,Stan,Ugh.
Land Before Swine,Narration,Dipper and Soos come in with the cameras
Land Before Swine,Dipper,We did it! It tripped the wire! Somewhere in one of these cameras is a photo of that creature! I'll go develop the film.
Land Before Swine,Soos,I'll go make us victory nachos. Dipper and Soos for life! (They fist bump and laugh. Then Dipper goes upstairs)
Land Before Swine,Stan,"And here, ladies and gentlemen, is our final exhibit, the most hideous creatures known to man! (He unveils a mirror, the tourists stare and laugh once they get the joke)"
Land Before Swine,Tourist,It's us. (more laughing)
Land Before Swine,Stan,"Right, right? We (laughs) we have fun here. But seriously, folks, (walks over to another exhibit) THIS is something. I present to you, a unicorn made OUT of corn, the Corn-i-corn! I- I don't know, I'm tired."
Land Before Swine,Narration,"(Stan unveils the corn-i-corn and they gasp, then frown as they see the destroyed mesh of wires.)"
Land Before Swine,Stan,What the!?
Land Before Swine,Narration,Waddles is seen eating one of the pieces of corn.
Land Before Swine,Tourist,"What a rip off! Kids, we're leaving. (The kids drop their merchandise and the tourists leave)"
Land Before Swine,Stan,No! Noooo! (He turns around to face Waddles) You!!
Land Before Swine,Narration,Waddles stares at him innocently and a piece of corn falls off his face
Land Before Swine,Narration,"Dipper is in his bedroom, converted to a dark room for the film"
Land Before Swine,Dipper,"C'mon, c'mon! Hmm... (he lifts up a picture of the pterodactyl's wing) That's a wing! If camera B got the wing, then the one that should have got the rest is... camera C! (He runs over to another picture being developed. The photo starts to appear) The creature!"
Land Before Swine,Narration,"Soos comes in, opening the door loudly"
Land Before Swine,Soos,Who wants victory nachos?
Land Before Swine,Narration,The picture of the creature fades away
Land Before Swine,Dipper,NO! (Picks up the photo and frowns)
Land Before Swine,Soos,"Dude don't worry. I only ate like a third of them. Half of 'em. (Starts laughing) I ate all of them, dude!"
Land Before Swine,Narration,Cuts to Stan taking Waddles outside theMystery Shack
Land Before Swine,Stan,"Just ten minutes without this pig in the house. (Starts tying Waddles to a peg) Is that so much to ask? (Hammers the peg to the ground) There. Mabel asks, this never happened. (Places a bill in Waddles' rope) (mocks Mabel) Oh, but Grunkle Stan, it's not safe out there! There's predators! (stops mocking) Oh brother..."
Land Before Swine,Narration,"The creature comes out of nowhere in a gust of wind, and snatches Waddles. Stan turns around while Waddles squeals loudly. The creature turns in the opposite direction"
Land Before Swine,Dipper,"I can't believe you, man!"
Land Before Swine,Soos,"Sorry, dude. I was just so excited! Nachos cause excitement!"
Land Before Swine,Dipper,"Soos, no offense, but you gotta be more careful sometimes. I mean, what are the odds we'll get another picture of the- (The creature flies by)"
Land Before Swine,Narration,Dipper and Soos run outside to see the creature. They see a trail of red yarn from Waddles' sweater through the woods.
Land Before Swine,Soos,"Dude, did you see that? That thing was a dinosaur, bro!"
Land Before Swine,Dipper,How is it possible a dinosaur survived 65 million years?
Land Before Swine,Soos,"Did you see it, Mr. Pines?... Mr. Pines?"
Land Before Swine,Stan,It- it took him.
Land Before Swine,Dipper,Took what?
Land Before Swine,Stan,The pig! It took Waddles!
Land Before Swine,Mabel,(rides up on bike) What did you say about Waddles? Oh. Woah. Awkward silence. (pause) BWAAAAH!
Land Before Swine,Narration,Commercial break
Land Before Swine,Mabel,What's going on? Why are you standing around all awkwardly?... And where's Waddles?
Land Before Swine,Stan,"Um- uh- (hides the stake he used to tie Waddles to) The good news is, you're gettin' a puppy!"
Land Before Swine,Mabel,What happened?
Land Before Swine,Stan,"Well, see, uh, when the uh-"
Land Before Swine,Soos,"Your pig got eaten by a p-terodactyl, bro! (pronounces the p)"
Land Before Swine,Mabel,"What?! Waddles? Waddles! Oh no, how did this happen? Grunkle Stan, you didn't put him outside?..."
Land Before Swine,Stan,What? No! I didn't put him anywhere! I'm not acting suspicious! YOU'RE acting suspicious. What's a pig?
Land Before Swine,Dipper,Then... what happened?
Land Before Swine,Stan,"Uh, look, it went down like this, see? So there I was, in the living room..."
Land Before Swine,Narration,Crossfade to fantasy sequence where Stan is lovingly caring for Waddles
Land Before Swine,Stan,... tenderly nursing him with only the richest of creams. When all of a sudden-
Land Before Swine,Narration,Pterodactyl bursts through the door and roars. It grabs Waddles out of Stan's arms.
Land Before Swine,Stan,"So I said, (imagining growing huge muscles and tearing off his shirt) ""No dice, cowboy!"" And I started punching him right in the face! But he played dirty..."
Land Before Swine,Narration,(Pterodactyl pokes Stan in the eyes)
Land Before Swine,Stan,That really happened! (in his imagination) Why? Why couldn't you have taken me!?' (starts crying)
Land Before Swine,Narration,"(crossfade back to reality, where he is pretending to cry)"
Land Before Swine,Mabel,"Oh, Grunkle Stan, you tried to save him! (gives Stan a hug)"
Land Before Swine,Stan,"Uh, yeah! I'm a great man, alright."
Land Before Swine,Dipper,You punched the pterodactyl in the face? I thought you didn't even believe in the supernatural.
Land Before Swine,Stan,"Dinosaurs aren't magic, they're just big lizards! Get off my back."
Land Before Swine,Mabel,"(Looking at a picture of herself and Waddles)Oh, Waddles."
Land Before Swine,Dipper,"That's it. No pterodactyl messes with MY sister. We're gonna go out there, catch him, and save your pig! For Mabel, guys!"
Land Before Swine,Soos,For Mabel!
Land Before Swine,Stan,But how do we even find the little guy?
Land Before Swine,Mabel,(gasps) We follow that! (points to the yarn trail from Waddles' sweater)
Land Before Swine,Dipper & Soos,Yes! Yeah! That's genius!
Land Before Swine,Stan,"Or, you know, we could just call it a day, maybe hit the pool hall, or- (stops as everyone stares at him) Yeah! Let's go... save Woggles!"
Land Before Swine,Mabel,Waddles.
Land Before Swine,Stan,Him too.
Land Before Swine,Narration,Cuts to Soos spraypainting the words PTERODACTYL MOBILE on the side of his pickup truck
Land Before Swine,Soos,All right! That p-terodactyl won't know what hit him!
Land Before Swine,Dipper,"Ha! It'spterodactyl, man."
Land Before Swine,Soos,"Actually, nobody knows how to pronounce it because no one was alive back in dinosaur days, so uh... (straps cage to truck and nearly gets run over) Whoa! Almost ran over my own head there! (Laughs) Wow."
Land Before Swine,Dipper,"Mabel, we've got to talk. This is a really high-stakes mission and I'm a little worried about Soos coming along on this one. I love the guy, but sometimes he messes stuff up."
Land Before Swine,Mabel,What? Since when?
Land Before Swine,Narration,"Cuts to Soos sweeping in the Mystery Shack. He knocks over a crystal ball, which shatters."
Land Before Swine,Soos,"Sorry, dude."
Land Before Swine,Narration,Cuts to Soos putting in a window. It falls out and breaks.
Land Before Swine,Soos,"Sorry, dude."
Land Before Swine,Narration,Cuts to Mabel and Dipper in their room. There is afairyoutside the window
Land Before Swine,Mabel,Look! A fairy!
Land Before Swine,Dipper,Whoa-ho!
Land Before Swine,Narration,"A flyswatter comes up and squishes the fairy, horrifying them. Soos' face appears"
Land Before Swine,Soos,"(laughing)Oh, sorry, dude, I killed that fairy!"
Land Before Swine,Narration,Cuts back to the present where Dipper and Mabel are staring at each other
Land Before Swine,Mabel,Let him down easy. (Watches Dipper go to talk to Soos)
Land Before Swine,Soos,"This is so great! You and me, bro. Best friends. Fighting and potentially high-fiving dinosaurs..."
Land Before Swine,Dipper,"Soos, look. I, uh, I've gotta tell you something."
Land Before Swine,Soos,"Okay. But before you do, check out these matching shirts I made for us! (points to shirt) Who's this guy right here? You! Totally you, dude. And these rays indicate friendship! So what was it you were going to tell me again?"
Land Before Swine,Dipper,"Uh... p-terodactyl, here we come! Uh, ha ha..."
Land Before Swine,Soos,Yes!
Land Before Swine,Dipper,(sighs)
Land Before Swine,Soos,Bros before dinos!
Land Before Swine,Mabel,"(pull up to abandoned church) Okay, the red yarn leads to..."
Land Before Swine,Old Man McGucket,Doodly doo do doo do!
Land Before Swine,Mabel,Old Man McGucket!?
Land Before Swine,McGucket,"Howdy, friends!"
Land Before Swine,Dipper,What are you doing out here?
Land Before Swine,McGucket,You'll never believe me! So I was doin' my hourly hootenanny- Deedly doo ding dang! (does dance)
Land Before Swine,Stan,"Ugh, this guy."
Land Before Swine,McGucket,When this enormous wing-ly critter stole my musical spoons and flew lickety-split into the abandoned mines down yonder!
Land Before Swine,Narration,(everyone looks down into the mines and gasps)
Land Before Swine,Stan,Looks kinda hairy down there.
Land Before Swine,Mabel,"C'mon, Grunkle Stan, you can handle it! You punched a pterodactyl in the face, remember?"
Land Before Swine,Stan,"Oh yeah! Heh heh, I did do that, didn't I? Heh... heh heh heh..."
Land Before Swine,McGucket,"My, what suspicious laughter!"
Land Before Swine,Mabel,"Guys, we're going in."
Land Before Swine,Old Man McGucket,Need someone to tag along and tell weird personal stories?
Land Before Swine,Stan,No thanks.
Land Before Swine,Narration,"(Cut to everyone, including Old Man McGucket, climbing down a rope into the depths of the mine)"
Land Before Swine,McGucket,"So there I am, fighting a raccoon for the same piece of meat, when our mouths get close and we kiss accidentally!"
Land Before Swine,Stan,"(sighs)You can't take a hint, can you?"
Land Before Swine,McGucket,Nope!
Land Before Swine,Narration,"(Shows rope fraying through, then breaking, spilling everyone to the ground below)"
Land Before Swine,Dipper,Whoa.
Land Before Swine,All,"(gasp, whisper in surprise)"
Land Before Swine,Dipper,These plants look all Jurassic-y.
Land Before Swine,Soos,"Huh! This little fella smells like battery acid!(Plant coughs acid into his face)Aaaugh! Looks like I lost my sense of smell, ha ha!"
Land Before Swine,Mabel,"(Looking at the same picture of herself and Waddles)Oh, Waddles. We're gonna find you."
Land Before Swine,Narration,"(They walk into a tunnel, where Dipper's lantern light falls on a petrified T-Rex and everyone screams, then calms down and gasps at all the dinosaurs.)"
Land Before Swine,Dipper,They're all trapped inside tree sap! That's how they survived for 65 million years!(Sees a sap pile with a pterodactyl-shaped hole)Whoa. The summer heat must be melting them loose!
Land Before Swine,Stan,"Holy moley! Forget the cornicorn, this is the attraction of a lifetime! I could bring people down here and turn this into some sort of theme park! Jurassic... Sap Hole!"
Land Before Swine,Soos,"Uh, dudes...(points to a velociraptor that has worked one single claw out of the sap and is slowly working on a hand)"
Land Before Swine,Dipper,Maybe... we should keep moving.
Land Before Swine,Stan,"This could be a gold mine! Velvety-rope type deal there, ticket booth here, ha! I should have put that pig outside ages ago!"
Land Before Swine,Mabel,Wait- what did you just say?
Land Before Swine,Stan,Hm? What's that?
Land Before Swine,Mabel,You said the dinosaur flew INTO the house.(Gasps and then frowns)
Land Before Swine,Stan,"No! Wait, uh, if you think about it-"
Land Before Swine,Mabel,"You put Waddles outside, then you lied to me about it! (Crying) And now thanks to you, my pig could be dead! WADDLES COULD BE DEAD!"
Land Before Swine,Stan,"Look, he's an animal. He belongs outside!"
Land Before Swine,Mabel,"No, that's it. Grunkle Stan, I am never ever speaking to you again!"
Land Before Swine,Stan,"Look, you can't be serious."
Land Before Swine,Mabel,"Oh, is someone talking right now? Because I can't hear them!"
Land Before Swine,Stan,Kid!
Land Before Swine,Mabel,LA LA LA LA LA! I can't hear anyone! No one's talking to me!
Land Before Swine,Soos,"Guys, guys, don't fight! Why can't you be more like me and Dipper? Look, everything's gonna be cool. All we gotta do to find the pig is follow this here yarn!(Wraps yarn into a ball, then realizes he has just reached the end)We just keep following and following, and when we reach the end... Oh- uh oh.(Stares into the network of mine shafts)Which- which cave was it again?"
Land Before Swine,Dipper,"Arghhh! Soos, you lost the trail!"
Land Before Swine,Soos,"Hey, come on. We'll find our way, TRUST me."
Land Before Swine,Narration,"(Soos whacks Dipper playfully on the back, causing the lantern Dipper is holding to fly out of his hands and break.)"
Land Before Swine,Soos,"...Sorry, dude."
Land Before Swine,Dipper,"Ugh! That is it! See, this is why I didn't want to bring you along!"
Land Before Swine,Soos,Wha- what...what do you mean?
Land Before Swine,Dipper,"I MEAN, this is really important to Mabel, and you keep screwing everything up! You ruined our photograph, and now you got us hopelessly lost!"
Land Before Swine,Soos,But we're p-terodactyl bros! I made t-shirts!
Land Before Swine,Dipper,"It's pronouncedpterodactyl! And these shirts are useless, they're gigantic!"
Land Before Swine,Soos,"I have a differentbody type, dude!"
Land Before Swine,Dipper,"Oh, so it's my fault?"
Land Before Swine,Narration,(The whole group deteriorates into an argument as Mabel and Stan start arguing again.)
Land Before Swine,McGucket,"Hey! Cheer up, fellers! I fixed your lantern!(Everyone stares at Old Man McGucket in horror as they realize that he is standing underneath the pterodactyl)"
Land Before Swine,All,AAAAAAAAUGH!
Land Before Swine,McGucket,(pause)AAAAAAAAUGH! Heh heh. What- what're we doing?
Land Before Swine,Narration,(commercial break)
Land Before Swine,McGucket,(turns around and sees the pterodactyl)Hmm? Oh. Nobody make any sudden movements or loud noises.(pause)YEEEEEEHAW! We found a pterodactyl!
Land Before Swine,Narration,"(The pterodactyl shrieks and starts chasing the gang down the narrow tunnel on all fours. It gets caught for a couple of seconds in a doorway, allowing them to hide behind some rocks before the pterodactyl comes.)"
Land Before Swine,Dipper,"Guys, we need a plan to get out of here."
Land Before Swine,Stan,"Okay, okay. How's about Mabel knits Soos a pig costume-"
Land Before Swine,Soos,I like it!
Land Before Swine,Stan,...and we use Soos as a human sacrifice!
Land Before Swine,Soos,I like it!
Land Before Swine,Stan,"What do you say, Mabel?"
Land Before Swine,Mabel,Hmph.
Land Before Swine,Stan,"Ah, come on, you can't stop talking to me forever."
Land Before Swine,Dipper,"Yeah, Mabel, we have to work together here."
Land Before Swine,Soos,"Oh, what, you want to work with Mabel but not your buddy, Soos?"
Land Before Swine,Narration,"(Soos, Dipper, and Stan start to argue to each other.)"
Land Before Swine,Waddles,WHONK! WHONK!
Land Before Swine,Mabel,"Wait, did you hear that?"
Land Before Swine,Narration,(Mabel see Waddles in a nest)
Land Before Swine,Mabel,Waddles!
Land Before Swine,Narration,(Mabel smiles and runs to the nest.)
Land Before Swine,Soos,"Oh, wait, kid."
Land Before Swine,Dipper,Mabel!
Land Before Swine,Stan,Are you nuts?
Land Before Swine,Mabel,"(sarcasm) Oh, is someone speaking? Because I can't hear anything!"
Land Before Swine,McGucket,Oh no! She's gone deaf with fear!
Land Before Swine,Dipper,"Mabel, come back here!"
Land Before Swine,Narration,(Everyone runs onto the mining cart track over to the nest)
Land Before Swine,Mabel,Waddles!
Land Before Swine,Waddles,(Grunts)
Land Before Swine,Mabel,"Oh, my Waddles! I'll never lose you again!(Rubs her face against Waddles)"
Land Before Swine,Dipper,(voice trembling as he notices the huge pile of human bones next to Mabel)Uh... Mabel?
Land Before Swine,Mabel,(to Waddles)Shh. You're safe now.
Land Before Swine,Dipper,"Mabel, quick! We gotta- now we gotta get out of here!"
Land Before Swine,Narration,(A huge shadow passes overhead and Waddles squeals in terror)
Land Before Swine,Waddles,WHOOONNNKK!
Land Before Swine,Narration,(Waddles immediately runs away)
Land Before Swine,Mabel,"Waddles, wait!"
Land Before Swine,Narration,(Waddles keep running)
Land Before Swine,Waddles,WHOONK! WHOONK!
Land Before Swine,Stan,Huh?
Land Before Swine,Narration,(Waddles jumps into Stan)
Land Before Swine,Stan,Ah!
Land Before Swine,Waddles,WHOONK! WHOONK!
Land Before Swine,Stan,"Get off me, you dumb pig!"
Land Before Swine,Narration,"(The pterodactyl swoops down on Stan and Waddles, screeching.)"
Land Before Swine,Dipper,Look out!
Land Before Swine,Narration,(Everyone screams as the pterodactyl knocks Stan off the mining track and down into a deep chasm filled with prehistoric plants)
Land Before Swine,Mabel,Oh no!
Land Before Swine,Dipper,Stan!
Land Before Swine,Soos,Mr. Pines!
Land Before Swine,Stan,Aaaaaaaaugh!(bounces off an enormous mushroom)Oof! Augh!(lands in a mud puddle)Ugh.
Land Before Swine,Waddles,"(grunting, rolling in the mud.)"
Land Before Swine,Stan,"Yeah, you would enjoy this.(Yells as the pterodactyl steals his fez)Aaaaaah! Huh?"
Land Before Swine,Narration,"(The pterodactyl drops Stan's fez in front of Dipper, Mabel, and Soos, who are crouching terrified in the pterodactyl's nest. They gasp.)"
Land Before Swine,Mabel,Guys! We gotta save them!
Land Before Swine,Dipper,"McGucket, do you have an invention that can distract the pterodactyl?"
Land Before Swine,McGucket,Do I!?(rummages around in hid hat for a few seconds)Nope.
Land Before Swine,Narration,"(Everyone gasps as the solitairy pterodactyl egg cracks, falls on its side, and opens to reveal a baby pterodactyl, which makes a squeaking peeping noise.)"
Land Before Swine,Mabel,Awwww!
Land Before Swine,McGucket,"Well, welcome to the world, little feller-(the baby pterodactyl eats him)AAAAUGH!"
Land Before Swine,"Dipper, Mabel, and Soos",(scream)
Land Before Swine,Narration,"(Meanwhile, Stan and Waddles are hiding under a massive mushroom. Stan looks up as the pterodactyl flies over them.)"
Land Before Swine,Stan,"The dumb thing must be hungry. I guess it's you or me, pig.(shoves Waddles out from under the mushroom)"
Land Before Swine,Waddles,(gives Stan a cute look)
Land Before Swine,Stan,"What are you looking at?(looks at Waddles sideways as Waddles again blinks at him)Aw come on, don't give me that look! What am I supposed to do, let it eat me?"
Land Before Swine,Waddles,(stares at him)
Land Before Swine,Stan,"Argh! Oh, I get it. You're trying to guilt me. Well it ain't working, pal. Who cares if you're Mabel's favorite thing in the world? I can live without the kid talking to me all the time!... Telling me her jokes... makin' me laugh..."
Land Before Swine,Waddles,(snorts and cocks head)
Land Before Swine,Stan,"(laughs, then notices the pterodactyl swooping down towards them)Aw! Dang it!(puts Waddles in the Huggy Wuvvy Tummy Bundle)Well, this is just about the dumbest thing I've ever done.(to the pterodactyl)YOU WANT THIS PIG?!"
Land Before Swine,Waddles,WHOONK!
Land Before Swine,Stan,"THEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET THROUGH ME, YOU FLYING DEVIL! COME AND GET ME!"
Land Before Swine,Narration,(slow-mo of Stan leaping at the pterodactyl. Cuts back to the baby pterodactyl)
Land Before Swine,Soos,Ah dude! Did he really just eat that prospecter guy? That is messed up!
Land Before Swine,Narration,The baby pterodactyl spits out McGucket's hat. Then old man McGucket comes up from the pterodactyl's neck and peeks out from the mouth.
Land Before Swine,McGucket,I'm okay!
Land Before Swine,Narration,"The baby pterodactyl swallows McGucket again. Mabel, Dipper and Soos back off."
Land Before Swine,Dipper,"What do we do, what do we do?"
Land Before Swine,Soos,We have to get in a straight line.
Land Before Swine,Dipper,What?
Land Before Swine,Soos,"The pterodactyl's eyes are so far apart, that if you stand right in front of it, it can't see you!"
Land Before Swine,Dipper,"Soos, you've been wrong about stuff all day. How can we-"
Land Before Swine,Soos,"Dude, look. I-I know I've messed up a lot. I could be sort of clumsy and.. It's not always as loveable as I think. But please, as my friend, just trust me on this one!"
Land Before Swine,Narration,Dipper looks at the baby pterodactyl and looks at Soos. Dipper gives a smile and nods at Soos.
Land Before Swine,Soos,"Get behind me, dudes!"
Land Before Swine,Narration,"Dipper and Mabel stand behind Soos. They move quietly. When the pterodactyl looks at them, they make a straight line. In the pterodactyl's eyes, they are out of its vision."
Land Before Swine,Mabel,It's working!
Land Before Swine,Narration,"They walk on the track, making a line. When the pterodactyl turns its head, they jump to the other line of the track. After they complete their crossing, the pterodactyl turns its attention to eating stuff. The Pines twins and Soos rest behind the rocks. They all sigh."
Land Before Swine,Dipper,"Soos, you did it!"
Land Before Swine,Narration,A cry of a pterodactyl is heard.
Land Before Swine,All,Huh?
Land Before Swine,Narration,"Looking up, the adult pterodactyl is flying around and a punching sound is heard."
Land Before Swine,Dipper,Was that...?
Land Before Swine,Mabel,Stan?
Land Before Swine,Narration,Close-up to the pterodactyl. Stan is punching it in its face in slow-mo. Mabel finds Waddles.
Land Before Swine,Mabel,Waddles!
Land Before Swine,Dipper,He's punching him in the face!
Land Before Swine,Stan,From heck's heart I stab at thee!!(Stabs at the pterodactyl)
Land Before Swine,Narration,"The pterodactyl hits the cliff, crashes to the ground and Stan climbs up the cliff."
Land Before Swine,Soos and Dipper,(Cheer at Stan)
Land Before Swine,Narration,Mabel stares at Stan delightly with Stan's hat.
Land Before Swine,Stan,"Here's your pig, kido.(Makes Waddles wave to Mabel)"
Land Before Swine,Mabel,Waddles!(Stan gives Waddles to Mabel. Mabel hugs Waddles)You saved him for me!
Land Before Swine,Stan,"(Takes the hat)Yeah, well.(Behind him, the pterodactyl is climbing up)Some times you just gotta... LOOK OUT!"
Land Before Swine,Narration,"They all start to run. The pterodactyl snaps at Dipper and rips his vest. Back at the entrance, they discover the rope to climb up is cut."
Land Before Swine,Stan,We're trapped!
Land Before Swine,Narration,Dipper sees the geyser pushing the rock up.
Land Before Swine,Dipper,Quick! The geyser could shoot us back up!
Land Before Swine,Narration,"They all climb in the geyser and the pterodactyl is approaching, but the geyser won't pump."
Land Before Swine,Dipper,"C'mon... Go, go!"
Land Before Swine,Narration,The pterodactyl roars and everyone screams.
Land Before Swine,Soos,Bros before dinos!(Hits the geyser hard)
Land Before Swine,Narration,The geyser pumps them up and they land into the church all wet. The building collapses and covers the hole. Cuts to the Pines leaving the church.
Land Before Swine,Mabel,I can't believe you did all that for Waddles!
Land Before Swine,Stan,"Ah, well. I can't have my favorite niece not talking to me.(Leans on a tree with sap on it)And if I gotta leap onto a pterodactyl and punch him in the face, then that's what I gotta do."
Land Before Swine,Mabel,That's kinda sappy.
Land Before Swine,Stan,W-what? That's how I feel!
Land Before Swine,Mabel,"No, I mean...(Points to Stan's hand)"
Land Before Swine,Stan,"Oh, yeah.(Touches Mabel's face with his sap-covered hand)Gotcha! Ha ha ha ha.(Realizes it doesn't come off)Uh-oh.(Tries to pull his hand off from Mabel. They both scream)"
Land Before Swine,Narration,"Cut to the car. At the back seat, Mabel, Waddles and Stan are sleeping. Zoom out to the front seat, which Dipper and Soos are sitting."
Land Before Swine,Dipper,"Check it out!(Holds his vest up. It has a hole)That thing destroyed my vest!(Discovers pterodactyl's tooth stuck in it)Soos, look!"
Land Before Swine,Soos,A real dinosaur tooth? That's awesome!
Land Before Swine,Dipper,Not as awesome as you saving us back there. Pterodactyl bros?
Land Before Swine,Soos,"Pterodactyl bros.(The two fist bump)Whoosh! Hey, I pronounced it right that time!"
Land Before Swine,Dipper,Think we need to worry about the rest of those dinosaurs?
Land Before Swine,Soos,I doubt it.
Land Before Swine,Narration,"The camera pans back to the church. From the hole, old man McGucket pops out."
Land Before Swine,McGucket,I ate my way through a dino-sour!(Laughs and plays his musical spoons)
Land Before Swine,Narration,Cuts to credits. Dipper and Soos are watching TV.
Land Before Swine,Bobby Renzobbi,"Hey, I'm Bobby Renzobbi. Are your arms jealous of your legs? Then you need ""Arm Pants!"" The pants that you wear on your arms!"
Land Before Swine,Dipper,Yeesh. Who actually buys these informercial stuff?
Land Before Swine,Soos,"I know, right?(Turns to the phone)Cancel the order, cancel the order!"
Land Before Swine,Narration,"The camera turns to Mabel, Waddles and Stan. They are playing poker."
Land Before Swine,Waddles,(Oinks)
Land Before Swine,Stan,Snorting! That's his tell! I fold.
Land Before Swine,Mabel,"(Stands up)Tough luck, sucker! Waddles was bluffing."
Land Before Swine,Stan,What? I had 4 aces! That pig is a wizard!
Land Before Swine,Narration,Waddles eats his cards.
Land Before Swine,Stan,Look at him. He's taunting me!
Land Before Swine,Mabel,I've been cheating the last 8 turns.
Land Before Swine,Stan,"Ha ha, that's my girl!"
Dreamscaperers,Narration,"The episode opens with an establishing shot ofGravity Fallsunder heavy downpour and thunder. Next scene shows theMystery Shack. In the bedroom attic,DipperandMabelare playingConflict Boat."
Dreamscaperers,Dipper Pines,I'm gonna say... B5.
Dreamscaperers,Mabel Pines,Miss! (Puts a peg on her board) Whop!
Dreamscaperers,Narration,"Camera shows Mabel's board, with her pegs arranged like a cat's face."
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,I don't think you're playing this right.
Dreamscaperers,Stan Pines,(Offscreen:)Kids! Come quick!
Dreamscaperers,Narration,Dipper and Mabel run downstairs. They enter the living room to find Stan watching television.
Dreamscaperers,Stan,(Laughs)I need you to laugh at this with me!
Dreamscaperers,Narration,A commercial for theTent of Telepathycomes on the television.
Dreamscaperers,Gideon Gleeful,"(On television, singing:)Who's cute as a button, and always your friend? Lil' G-I-D to the E-O-N! Wink!"
Dreamscaperers,Bud Gleefulon TV,Li'l Gideon!
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,"(disgusted)Ugh, Gideon!"
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,Remember whenI wouldn't date him and he tried to destroy us?
Dreamscaperers,Stan,He's always trying to trick me into losing the Mystery Shack!
Dreamscaperers,Wendy Corduroy,"One time, I caught him stealing my moisturizer."
Dreamscaperers,Soos Ramirez,"And yet, our mutual hatred for him bonds us together."
Dreamscaperers,Gideon,(Laughs)
Dreamscaperers,Bud,"(On television, voice-over:)Come on down to Li'l Gideon's Tent 'o' Telepathy, opening soon at this location."
Dreamscaperers,Narration,Commercial shows the Tent of Telepathy crushing the Mystery Shack.
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,"Uh, should we be worried about that?"
Dreamscaperers,Stan,"Please, the only way Gideon's taking over this shack is by breaking in and stealing mydeed."
Dreamscaperers,Narration,A loud crash is heard from upstairs.
Dreamscaperers,Wendy,"You mean like, right now?"
Dreamscaperers,Narration,"Cuts to Stan's office, where Gideon is attempting to open Stan's safe."
Dreamscaperers,Gideon,"Uh, thirty-eight? Forty-one? Oh, heavens to Betsy!(Stan opens the office door)"
Dreamscaperers,Stan,Gideon!
Dreamscaperers,Gideon,"Well, well, Stanford! My arch-nemesis. We seem to have entered a dangerous game of cat and mouse. But the question remains, who is the cat, and who is the--"
Dreamscaperers,Stan,"Soos, broom.(Soos gives the broom to Stan)"
Dreamscaperers,Gideon,"Oh no, not the broom!"
Dreamscaperers,Stan,(Chases Gideon around the room with the broom)
Dreamscaperers,Gideon,(Hisses)
Dreamscaperers,Stan,(Hits Gideon with the broom twice before chasing him outside)
Dreamscaperers,Gideon,"You mark my words, Stanford! One day I'm gonna get that combination! And once I steal that deed, you'll never see the Mystery Shack again!"
Dreamscaperers,Stan,"Good luck, bucko!"
Dreamscaperers,Narration,Stan goes back inside and shuts the door. Close up of Gideon looking angry.
Dreamscaperers,Narration,Cuts to Stan putting the Mystery Shack deed in his safe and pressing the lock button.
Dreamscaperers,Stan,(Laughs)The combo to this safe is in the one place he'll never find it: my brain.(Walks away)
Dreamscaperers,Gideon,"Your brain isn't as safe as you might think, Stanford Pines! (Pulls outJournal 2) This is the last straw! It's time to unlock the journal's greatest secret..."
Dreamscaperers,Narration,Camera zooms in on picture of theZodiacseen in theopening sequence.
Dreamscaperers,Narration,Cut totheme song.
Dreamscaperers,Narration,"Dipper, Mabel, Stan, and Wendy are watching television. Dipper and Wendy are shooting each other withNyarfbrand dart guns."
Dreamscaperers,Television,"He put the old in ""old west,"" they call him(musically:)Grandpa the Kid!"
Dreamscaperers,Grandpa the Kid,(On television)I'm tired during the day.
Dreamscaperers,Stan,I can relate to this.
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,"Grunkle Stan, why can't we watch a movie that we'll all enjoy?Dream Boy High! ""Where love is on your permanent record."""
Dreamscaperers,"Stan, Dipper and Wendy",Boo!
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,You'll learn to like it.
Dreamscaperers,Narration,A crash is heard from the kitchen.
Dreamscaperers,Soos,"(Runs into the room)Aaah! Dudes, there's a bat in the kitchen! It tried to touch me with its ""weird little bat fingers!"""
Dreamscaperers,Stan,"Don't worry, I got this under control.(Leans back in armchair)Dipper, take care of it."
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,"(Laughs, while Dipper looks shocked)Yes!"
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,What? Why can't Mabel do it?
Dreamscaperers,Stan,'Cause life ain't fair. Now go fight a bat so we can watch TV.
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,"(Walks to Stan, annoyed)No way, Grunkle Stan! You always make me do dumb chores. I'm putting my foot down this time!(Stamps foot on carpet)"
Dreamscaperers,Stan,"I said do it, kid. Now!"
Dreamscaperers,Narration,Old west music plays.
Dreamscaperers,Narration,"Stan and Dipper have a stare off, growling at each other. Stan wins, showing all his teeth like a ferocious beast. This finally convinces Dipper to go to take care of the bat."
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,"Okay, I'll do it!(Sighs; walks into kitchen, Mabel following behind him)"
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,"(Picks up a saucepan and spoon on the floor, mumbling)Stupid chores..."
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,"Remember, bats are more afraid of you than you are of them."
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,"(Enters the kitchen, offscreen)"
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,Maybe I'm thinking of ducklings.
Dreamscaperers,Narration,"Loud screams and crashes come from the kitchen, while kitchen supplies and Dipper's hat are thrown outside."
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,Ducklings.(Laughs)Quack quack! Quack quack quack!
Dreamscaperers,Narration,Cuts to Soos applying disinfectant to Dipper's wounds while Mabel applies bandages to Dipper's head.
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,"Ow, ow!"
Dreamscaperers,Soos,"(Singing:)Swabbing on disinfectant, doo doo doo..."
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,"(Sighs)Why does Grunkle Stan always pick on me? Think about it! The more painful or difficult the chore is, the more likely it is I'll have to do it. Why doesn't he pick on you guys?"
Dreamscaperers,Soos,"Dipper, Stan's personality is one of life's great mysteries. Like whether or not it's possible to lick your own elbow."
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,I bet you can't!
Dreamscaperers,Soos,I bet I can!(Tries to lick elbow and walks away)
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,(Following Soos; chanting:)Lick it! Lick it! Lick it!
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,Sometimes I feel like Stan hates me.(Looks up to a picture of Stan on the wall)
Dreamscaperers,Stan,"(Offscreen, yelling:)The sink's clogged. Dipper, get in here and fix it!"
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,"(Growls angrily in resentment towards his great-uncle, grabs his Nyarf dart gun and fires it at the picture of Stan.)"
Dreamscaperers,Narration,"The scene fades into the same picture of Stan, except with a red ""X"" painted over his eyes and surrounded by candles."
Dreamscaperers,Gideon,"You think that combination's safe in your mind, Stanford? We'll see what my new minion has to say about that!(Chanting:)Triangulum, entangulum. Vene foris dominus mentium. Vene foris videntis omnium!(Broken Latin for ""Triangle, entangled. Lord of Minds, come to the door. All-seeing one, come to the door!"")"
Dreamscaperers,Narration,"Cuts to Mabel and Soos outside, Soos is still attempting to lick his own elbow, with Mabel still chearing him on."
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,(Chanting:)Lick that elbow! Lick that elbow!
Dreamscaperers,Soos,"Like the infinite horizon, it eludes my grasp."
Dreamscaperers,Gideon,"(Offscreen, laughs ominously)"
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,Is that who I think it is?
Dreamscaperers,Narration,Mabel and Soos walk toward Gideon.
Dreamscaperers,Gideon,"(Grunting, clasps his stomach and his eyes glow blue; chants:)Egassem sdrawkcab. egassem sdrawkcab. Egassem sdrawkcab! Egassem sdrawkcab! Egassem sdrawkcab!"
Dreamscaperers,Narration,"The background turns black and white, a dragonfly and a frog slowly freeze in time. Above Gideon, a flaming black triangle with a lone eye appears in the cloudy sky, laughing evilly. Gaping skyward, Soos and Mabel hide behind the bushes. The triangle then sprouts arms, legs, a top hat and a bowtie. The triangle's color changes to yellow as it hovers down to Gideon."
Dreamscaperers,Bill Cipher,"Oh, oh, Gravity Falls! It is good to be back. Name's Bill Cipher, and I take it you're some kind of living ventriloquist dummy?(Laughs)I'm just kidding, I know who you are, Gideon!"
Dreamscaperers,Gideon,W-what are you? H-how do you know my name?!
Dreamscaperers,Bill,"Oh, I know lots of things!(Body shows pictures of various cryptic locations. In a slow, deep voice:)LOTS OF THINGS...(Body returns to normal)Hey, look what I can do!(Gestures toward a deer, the deer's teeth then fly into his hand. Gives the teeth to Gideon)Deer teeth! For you, kid!(Laughs)"
Dreamscaperers,Gideon,(Cries out in shock and drops teeth on the ground)You're insane!
Dreamscaperers,Bill,"Sure I am, what's your point?(Puts teeth back in deer's mouth and the deer runs away)"
Dreamscaperers,Gideon,"(Tries to steady himself)Listen to me, demon! I have a job for you. I need you to enter the mind of Stanford Pines and steal the code to his safe."
Dreamscaperers,Mabel and Soos,(Gasp)
Dreamscaperers,Bill,"(Laughs)Wait... Stan Pines?(Body shows pictures of Stan and histattoo)You know what, kid? You've convinced me! I'm sold! I'll help you with this and in return you can help me with something I've been working on! We'll work out the details later."
Dreamscaperers,Gideon,Deal!
Dreamscaperers,Bill,"(His hand lights on blue fire and he shakes hands with Gideon)Well, time to invade Stan's mind! This should be fun! Remember: reality is an illusion, the universe is a hologram, buy gold, bye!(Disappears)"
Dreamscaperers,Gideon,It worked!(Laughs maniacally)
Dreamscaperers,Narration,Cut to Dipper sweeping the carpet in the living room while Stan sleeps in his chair.
Dreamscaperers,Stan,"(Mumbling in his sleep)Oh, I'm so sorry."
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,What is going on in that guy's head?(Begins to walk away)
Dreamscaperers,Narration,Mabel and Soos run in.
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,Dipper! We've gotta help Stan!
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,"Wait, what?"
Dreamscaperers,Soos,"(While eatingNyumsbrandBurrito Bites)This evil triangle guy... said he's gonna break into Stan's mind, and steal the combination to his safe! Also we stopped for snacks on the way here."
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,"Triangle guy?(Takes outJournal 3)I feel like I've seen something like this before in the journal...(Reading:)""Beware Bill! The most powerful and dangerous creature I've ever encountered.(Closeup on a note written in red marker: ""DO NOT SUMMON AT ALL COSTS!"")Whatever you do, never let him into your mind."""
Dreamscaperers,Stan,(Grunts in sleep)
Dreamscaperers,"Dipper, Mabel and Soos",(Gasp)
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,Grunkle Stan!
Dreamscaperers,Narration,Cut to shadow of Bill entering Stan's mind.
Dreamscaperers,Stan,(Eyes start glowing blue and grunts while making random movements)
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,"(Takes the journal from Dipper; reads:)""It is possible to follow the demon into a person's mind and prevent his chaos. One must simply recite this incantation."""
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,"(feeling adversed)Ugh, this is just great. I spend all day cleaning sinks and fighting bats for Stan, and now I have to save him from some crazy brain demon?"
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,"But if we don't do anything, Gideon might steal the shack! Or worse!"
Dreamscaperers,Stan,"(Eyes still glowing blue, he screams)"
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,"(Sighs, reluctantly)Fine. Get ready, guys. We're about to journey into the most horrifying, disturbing place any of us have ever been: our uncle's mind."
Dreamscaperers,Narration,Lightning flashes and dramatic music plays.
Dreamscaperers,Soos,"You think I can take these Burrito Bites into Stan's brain? Thumbs up? Thumbs down?(Pauses; laughs)You know what, I'm just gonna bring 'em."
Dreamscaperers,Narration,Cut to commercial break.
Dreamscaperers,Narration,"Cut to Dipper, Mabel and Soos around a sleeping Stan in the living room with the lights off and surrounded by a circle of candles."
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,"(Holding Journal 3)Okay, guys, in order to save our uncle, we're gonna have to follow that... dream demon into his mind."
Dreamscaperers,Soos,I wonder what Stan's thinking about right now.
Dreamscaperers,Soos,"(Using Stan as a ventriloquist dummy, in a high voice:)I love Soos like a son!"
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,Soos! This is serious!
Dreamscaperers,Soos,(Still using Stan's mouth in a high voice)Sorry!
Dreamscaperers,Mabel and Soos,(Laugh)Yeah!(High five each other)
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,Let's do this.(Puts hand on Stan's head)
Dreamscaperers,Narration,Mabel and Soos also put their hands on Stan's head.
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,(Reading from journal:)Videntus omnium. Magister mentium. Magnesium ad hominem. Magnum opus. Habeas corpus! Inceptus Nolanus overratus! Magister mentium! Magister mentium! MAGISTER MENTIUM!
Dreamscaperers,Narration,"As Dipper speaks, his eyes go blue, then Soos', then Mabel's and the candles go out, and after the incantation, there is a flash of white light and the gang is insideStan's mind. The mindscape is entirely in black and white. Mabel and Soos make exclamations of awe."
Dreamscaperers,Soos,What the...?
Dreamscaperers,Narration,The scene shows the gang approach a bizarre and warped version of the Mystery Shack with an 8-ball posing as the full moon in the background. Next scene shows an empty swing set with the left swing slowly creaking and the right swing broken completely. The gang continue walking forward to the shack.
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,"Whoa, this is Stan's mind?"
Dreamscaperers,Soos,Huh. Figured there would be a lot more hot old ladies.
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,"Remember, everyone, we've got to look out for the triangle guy."
Dreamscaperers,Bill,"(Arriving in front of gang, whirling his cane)Yeah, look out for the triangle guy!"
Dreamscaperers,Soos,It's him! It's the guy!
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,"You leave our uncle's brain alone, you isosceles monster!(Charges into Bill and disappears inside him. Bill holds up a numeral pocket-watch for a few seconds. He then spits Mabel out of his body)Gotcha! Wait, what?"
Dreamscaperers,Bill,"Ah, Stan's family, we meet at last! Question Mark, Shooting Star, Pine Tree, I had a hunch I might bump into you!(He points and shoots a red laser in Dipper's chest)"
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,"(Screams, deep breathing)"
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,(Sticks her hand through Dipper's hole)Boop!
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,Mabel! What do you want with our uncle's mind anyway?
Dreamscaperers,Bill,"Oh, just the code to the old man's safe! Inside the shack is a maze of a thousand doors representing your uncle's memories. Behind one of them is a memory of him inputting the code! I just need to find it and Gideon will pay me handsomely."
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,Not if we stop you!
Dreamscaperers,Bill,"Hah, fat chance! I'm the master of the mind.(Blue flames encircle him)I even know what you're thinking right now!"
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,"That's impossible, no one can guess what I'm thinking!"
Dreamscaperers,Narration,Bill makesXyler and Crazappear with a finger snap.
Dreamscaperers,Xyler,"Whoa, where are we, bro?"
Dreamscaperers,Craz,"We must be in heaven, 'cause I just saw an angel!(points to Mabel)"
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,(Hugging Craz's leg)I'm never letting go of your leg!
Dreamscaperers,Bill,"You're out of your league, kids.(Serious tone)Turn around now before you see something you might regret. Later, suckers!(Crashes through wall of mindscape Mystery Shack)"
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,"We're goin' in! Mabel, can we leave those guys out here? Looking at them--(He sees 1980s-esque visual effects around Tyler and Craz)hurts my eyes..."
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,No! They can help us!
Dreamscaperers,Xyler and Craz,Totally! Arm throne!(Carry Mabel in arms)
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,(Chuckles)
Dreamscaperers,Soos,Dude! Arm throne!(Starts walking after Dipper)Arm throoone!
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,(Screams)
Dreamscaperers,Narration,"Everyone steps into the shack and awes. There are multiple floors, stairs and doors floating inside the domain."
Dreamscaperers,Craz,Radical!
Dreamscaperers,Xyler,I also think it's radical!
Dreamscaperers,Stan Bat,(Flying by Dipper walking down steps)No refunds! No refunds! No refunds!(Repeats)
Dreamscaperers,Narration,"Some of Stan's fears are shown, and it cuts to the gang entering Stan's memories, all speaking."
Dreamscaperers,Soos,"Whoa, look! All of Stan's memories!"
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,"Great. Sure there's plenty of memories of Stan bossing me around, can't wait to see more of that."
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,"Come on, Dipper, we've gotta find the code before Bill does!"
Dreamscaperers,Craz,Mabel is talking!
Dreamscaperers,Xyler,So rad!
Dreamscaperers,Soos,Let's get searching!
Dreamscaperers,Narration,"Gang runs down a hallway, panting. Dipper opens a door."
Dreamscaperers,Narration,Cut to show a younger Stan in Colombian prison with the two of his gruff-looking cellmates Jorge and Rico.
Dreamscaperers,Stan,"Jorge, Rico, you're the two best Colombian prison friends a fellah could make."
Dreamscaperers,Jorge,"Espero que muera.(Subtitles read ""I hope he dies."")"
Dreamscaperers,Rico,"Sí.(Subtitle reads ""Sí."")"
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,Nope!
Dreamscaperers,Narration,Dipper closes the door. Cut to Soos opening another door.
Dreamscaperers,Narration,Cut to show Stan posing as a salesman outside a home.
Dreamscaperers,Stan,"Sir, would you like to buy aStan-Vacvacuum? Stan-Vac: It sucks more than anything.(Door shuts in front of him)Gotta work on that."
Dreamscaperers,Soos,Nope.
Dreamscaperers,Narration,Cut to Soos closing the door.
Dreamscaperers,Narration,Cut to Mabel opening a small door.
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,"Whoa, it's Stan on a date!"
Dreamscaperers,Narration,Cuts to Stan on a date withLazy Susan.
Dreamscaperers,Stan,"So, your, uh... your eye is weird. Let's... let's talk about that."
Dreamscaperers,Lazy Susan,(Laughs awkwardly)
Dreamscaperers,Stan,(Laughing awkwardly; thinking:)This is going terrible. I can't think of anything to say and she... looks weird up close. Think of a way out!(Stands up; Aloud:)NON-SPECIFIC EXCUSE!(Knocks food off the table and runs away)
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,Yeesh.(Closes the door)
Dreamscaperers,Narration,"Dipper discovers a door written ""Dipper Memories: KEEP OUT!"""
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,"Look, guys! Memories about me!(Opens the door)"
Dreamscaperers,Soos,That doesn't seen like a good idea.
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,I just wanna know what the old guy really thinks of me.
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,We already know how Stan feels about us! He loves us! We're great.(Walks away)
Dreamscaperers,Soos,Yeah. Let's just keep moving.
Dreamscaperers,Xyler,More moving?
Dreamscaperers,Craz,Yes! I love motion!
Dreamscaperers,Narration,"Dipper walks a bit, but turns around and runs to the Dipper memories door and enters it. Inside, a crab with Stan's head scuttles on another sign written ""Dipper Memories: No Refunds""."
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,Okay. Just a quick peek.
Dreamscaperers,Narration,Dipper walks by the doors. The sound Stan calling Dipper echoes. Dipper walks in front of one of them and opens the door. Inside is a memory of Stan making Dipper chop firewood.
Dreamscaperers,Stan,No buts! Now go chop that firewood already!(Hits Dipper's head with a newspaper)
Dreamscaperers,Narration,Dipper walks away to chop the firewood. Stan sits on the couch next to Soos.
Dreamscaperers,Soos,"Dude, Stan, I've been meaning to ask you. Why are you so hard on Dipper all the time?"
Dreamscaperers,Stan,"Look, Soos, I'm gonna let you in on something. You wanna know what I really think?(He hushes indistinct whispers to Soos)"
Dreamscaperers,Narration,Dipper leans to listen what Stan is talking.
Dreamscaperers,Stan,(In a whisper:)The kid's a loser. He's weak! He's an utter embarrassment!
Dreamscaperers,Narration,Cut to see memory Dipper struggling to chop the firewood stuck to his hatchet.
Dreamscaperers,Stan,I just wanna get rid of him.
Dreamscaperers,Narration,"Frowning, Dipper lowers his head and closes the door on Stan's memory, depressed. Cuts to Bill, disguised as Soos, and Mabel."
Dreamscaperers,Bill,Hello? Code to Stan's safe? Where are you?
Dreamscaperers,Xyler,Opening and closing doors is fun!
Dreamscaperers,Craz,I can do it also!
Dreamscaperers,Narration,Bill opens a door. Inside the door Stan pushes buttons of thevending machine. The vending machine opens and a secret hallway appears.
Dreamscaperers,Stan,"If only people knew the truth, that hidden behind this vending machine, I secretly have a--"
Dreamscaperers,Bill,BORING!(Closes the door shut)
Dreamscaperers,Narration,"Cuts to Mabel in front of a door written ""Top Secret"" on top of it."
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,"Alright guys, I have a good feeling about this door."
Dreamscaperers,Narration,Mabel opens the door. Inside it has a memory of Stan in the bathroom.
Dreamscaperers,Stan,"Hey, Mr. Tummy!(Changes his voice)Hey, Mr. Stan!(Back to normal voice)Are you hungry?(Changes his voice again)Yes!"
Dreamscaperers,Bill,(Cringes in disgust)Ugh...
Dreamscaperers,Stan,Eat your crackers!(Changes his voice)Yum yum yum yum!
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,Sweet Sally!(Closes the door)
Dreamscaperers,Bill,"Hah, we've been searching forever! What if the triangle guy finds the memory before we do?"
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,"If we wanna find Stan's memory, we gotta think like Stan. He's always hiding stuff, right?"
Dreamscaperers,Bill,Yeah! Like how he hides his arrest warrants under that rug in the gift shop?
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,"Soos, that's it! Look!(Walks to a rug and finds a door under it)"
Dreamscaperers,All,(Gasp)
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,(Opens the door)
Dreamscaperers,Stan,"(Kisses the deed and puts it into the safe)There ya go.(Closes the safe door)And now to input the code. 13, 44, and finally..."
Dreamscaperers,Bill,"(Closes the door)Dude, we found it!"
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,Yeah!
Dreamscaperers,Xyler and Craz,But what do we do now? Jinx!
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,Um... um... Let's just destroy the door before Bill can find it!(Finds a battle-ax)
Dreamscaperers,Bill,Wait! Maybe I should do it! My big fat arms are great at destroying stuff!
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,"Oh, okay."
Dreamscaperers,Narration,"Bill begins to lifts up the door with some kind of psychic power. As he does this, the real Soos walks in."
Dreamscaperers,Soos,"Hey, guys! I just saw a memory of Stan roller skating and wearing short-shorts!(Pause)Didn't look... didn't look half-bad.(Long pause)Hey, somethin' weird is goin' on here."
Dreamscaperers,Bill,"(Still in Soos' form, laughs evilly; turns back to normal)Boy, you kids sure are gullible! I knew you'd lead me straight to the code!(continues laughing)It's funny how dumb you are."
Dreamscaperers,Narration,Commercial break.
Dreamscaperers,Bill,"The combination to Stan's safe. Boy, that was even easier than I thought!"
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,"Oh, yeah? Well, you're a-a stink face!"
Dreamscaperers,Xyler,"Awesome comeback, Mabel!"
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,"Don't treat me like a child, Xyler."
Dreamscaperers,Bill,"Later, suckers!(Flies away)"
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,Come on! We've gotta save Stan!
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,"(Walking down the stairs, feeling negative and resentful)What's the point? Why should I save him, huh? I work for Stan day and night and all he does in return is say he wants to get rid of me."
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,"(in disbelief)Dipper, I'm sure that's not true."
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,"(resentful)I saw it with my own eyes in one of his memories, Mabel! He's always picked on me and now I know why.(now enraged)Stanhatesme!"
Dreamscaperers,Everyone except Dipper,(Gasp in shock)
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,"Dipper, it doesn't matter what you saw. If we don't stop Bill, we'll lose the Shack!"
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,"No! You know what? Not this time. For once, this is one of Stan's problems I'm not gonna fix."
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,"Fine. Come on, Soos. We'll save Stan ourselves."
Dreamscaperers,Soos,"Dipper, you're a cool dude, but... this isn't cool, dude."
Dreamscaperers,Craz,"Let's go, Xyler."
Dreamscaperers,Xyler,"All right, Craz!"
Dreamscaperers,Craz,Those are our names!
Dreamscaperers,Narration,"Mabel, Craz, Xyler and Soos leave the sulking Dipper behind. Cuts to Bill. Bill opens every door he passes. Then a phone ringing sound is heard. Bill touches his bowtie revealing he has a call from Gideon."
Dreamscaperers,Bill,Y'ello?
Dreamscaperers,Gideon,Bill! Did you find the memory with the combination yet?
Dreamscaperers,Bill,"Relax, short stack. I got it right here."
Dreamscaperers,Gideon,Ha ha ha! Perfect. Now give it to me and I'll fulfill my end of the bargain.
Dreamscaperers,Bill,"Finally! It's--you got a pen there? It's 13, 44...(The door gets hit by a nyarf gun)Ah! No no no! Wait, no!"
Dreamscaperers,Narration,The door falls to thebottomless pitfrom one of Stan's memories.
Dreamscaperers,Stan,"...and none more bottomless than the bottomless pit! Which, as you can see here, is bottomless.(Watches the door fall)Whooh! Whatever that was, it's gone forever!"
Dreamscaperers,Narration,The door closes. Behind Bill is Mabel who shot the door with a nyarf gun.
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,Ha ha! Boom!
Dreamscaperers,Xyler and Craz,Mabel did it!
Dreamscaperers,Soos,The Shack is safe!
Dreamscaperers,Gideon,The deal's off!
Dreamscaperers,Bill,Wa-wait! No! Wait!
Dreamscaperers,Gideon,I'm switchin' to plan B!
Dreamscaperers,Narration,The screen turns off and Bill's body cracks to pieces and falls off. Then Bill's body reappears as red.
Dreamscaperers,Bill,"YOU! You can't even imagine what you just cost me!(Conjures flames out of his hands)Do you have any idea what I'm like...(In a low, demonic voice:)WHEN I'MMAD???!!"
Dreamscaperers,Narration,"Glowing yellow symbols appear inside Bill's blackened eye. As the symbols reflect on the others' faces, a ring of fire surrounds them. Then a rock in the shape of Stan's head pops out from their feet and raises up into the cosmos. Bill's size starts increasing."
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,(Gasp)
Dreamscaperers,Soos,So I guess he gets really mad when he gets mad.
Dreamscaperers,Bill,"(In a low, demonic voice:)EAT NIGHTMARES!!"
Dreamscaperers,All,(Scream)
Dreamscaperers,Narration,"Cut to Dipper walking around, finding a way out."
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,"Ugh! How do I get out of this place?(Opens doors)Exit? Hello? (Opens the door with a memory of him chopping wood) Aw, this again?"
Dreamscaperers,Stan,He's a loser. He's weak. I just wanna get rid of him.
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,(Starts to close the door)
Dreamscaperers,Stan,"Heh, yeah. Those are all things people said about me when I was a boy."
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,"(Opens the door, surprised by what he just heard)Huh?"
Dreamscaperers,Stan,It was terrible. I was the biggest wimp on the playground!
Dreamscaperers,Narration,A door of Stan's memory opens behind Dipper. It shows Stan as a kid getting bullied by other kids and running with tears while the bullies cruelly mock him.
Dreamscaperers,Stan,"So one summer,my popsigns up me for boxing lessons."
Dreamscaperers,Narration,A door of Stan boxing opens. He is getting punched by his opponent.
Dreamscaperers,Stan,And it was even worse than the school yard!
Dreamscaperers,Young Stan,"Left hook!(Punches his opponent and his father is seen in the sidelines, nodding.)"
Dreamscaperers,Stan,"Y'know, at the time, I thought my pop was trying to torture me."
Dreamscaperers,Narration,A door of Stan at the theater opens.
Dreamscaperers,Stan,But wouldn't you know it? The old man was doin' me a favor all along!
Dreamscaperers,Man,(Tries to stealCarla'sbag.) Give me that bag!
Dreamscaperers,Carla,Help! My purse! Help!
Dreamscaperers,Young Stan,"Left hook!(Punches the man in the face, shattering his teeth)"
Dreamscaperers,Narration,The people all around Stan cheers for him. Carla gives him a kiss.
Dreamscaperers,Stan,"So you see? That why I'm hard on Dipper. To toughen him up. So when the world fights, he fights back.(Hiding behind, Dipper smiles. He no longer feels resentful)"
Dreamscaperers,Soos,Do you think it's actually working?
Dreamscaperers,Stan,(Points at Dipper)
Dreamscaperers,Dipper (in the memory),(Chops the wood in a half)I-I did it! Ha ha! Yes!
Dreamscaperers,Stan,"He's really comin' along! When push comes to shove, I'm actually proud of him. Just... don't ever tell him that.(Playfully elbows)His head's big enough as it is."
Dreamscaperers,Soos,(Laughs)That's true.
Dreamscaperers,Narration,"Dipper grins and puts his hand on the memory, now realizing that his great-uncle cares for him. Then he accidentally gets into the memory, facing with Stan."
Dreamscaperers,Stan,"Whoa, kid, what are you doin' here? Nice hole in your chest, by the way. Let's fix that up.(Points his finger and the hole in Dipper's chest closes)"
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,(Surprised)Wh-what the-- How did you do that?
Dreamscaperers,Stan,"Word to the wise, kid. We're in the mind! You could do whatever you can imagine in here!(Creates a Pitt Cola in his hand and drinks it)"
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,"Well, how about that?"
Dreamscaperers,Narration,"Suddenly, the ground shakes with red lights flashing out the memory corridor. Bill is heard laughing manically; Soos' and Mabel's screams are heard outside from the memory."
Dreamscaperers,Soos,(Off screen)NO! MAKE IT STOP!
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,"(Off screen)HELP! SOMEONE, PLEASE!"
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,"Oh my gosh, what am I doing? I gotta stop Bill!(Runs out of the memory)"
Dreamscaperers,Stan,"Huh, fighting back."
Dreamscaperers,Narration,Cut to Bill tormenting the gang.
Dreamscaperers,Bill,"One nightmare, coming up!"
Dreamscaperers,Soos,Nightmare? Hope he doesn't mean thatBritish dog manI'm always dreaming about...
Dreamscaperers,Narration,The British dog man appears in front of Soos.
Dreamscaperers,British dog man,"'Ello, 'ello, 'ello! Who's crike for a stick in the pudding?(Pokes Soos with his cane)"
Dreamscaperers,Soos,(Screams and jumps around in horror)It's everything I ever feared!
Dreamscaperers,Bill,YOU!(Strikes a nightmare to Mabel)
Dreamscaperers,Narration,Mabel becomes green and ugly. Her voice also changes low and slow.
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,(Screams)My cuteness!(Voice distorted)What did you do to my -(In a low voice:)cuteness?(Blowing a raspberry)
Dreamscaperers,Bill,You're next!(Points at Xyler and Craz)
Dreamscaperers,Craz,Cool! We're next!
Dreamscaperers,Narration,Craz dances with Xyler but they both get knocked out by Bill's beam. They burn and vanish.
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,(In a low voice:)My dream boys!
Dreamscaperers,Bill,"And now to finish you off, once and for all!"
Dreamscaperers,Mabel and Soos,"No, no!"
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,(Flies in)Hey! Bill!
Dreamscaperers,Bill,(Sees Dipper and becomes shocked)WHAT?!!
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,Nice bowtie!(Makes a hole in Bill with laser from his eyes)
Dreamscaperers,Bill,AAAARGH!!!
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,(In a low voice:)Dipper!
Dreamscaperers,Soos,Dude!
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,Guys! I just learned that you can conjure whatever you can conceive in Grunkle Stan's mindscape!
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,(In a low voice:)Huuuh?
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,Just think of cool fighting stuff and it'll happen. Like this!(Disintegrates the British dog man with his laser eyes)
Dreamscaperers,Soos,"Ha ha, he's dead now."
Dreamscaperers,Bill,What? Who told you that?! Don't listen to him!
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,"We can do anything?(Comes back to normal, along with her voice)Like have kittens for fists?(Her fists becomes kittens; as she shoots them at Bill:)Po-pow! P-p-pow! Pow!"
Dreamscaperers,Narration,The kitten fists stick on Bill's face and body.
Dreamscaperers,Bill,(Screams)
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,"(The kittens on her hands start licking her; laughs)Well hello, friends!"
Dreamscaperers,Soos,"Anything, huh? Soos Love Stomach Beam STARE-E-E-E! (Shoots colorful question marks from stomach and knocks Bill off the edge)"
Dreamscaperers,Bill,(Covers his hole)Enough games!(Shoots laser from his eye)

Dreamscaperers,Soos and Dipper,Activate!(Creates a hamster ball around themselves)
Dreamscaperers,Narration,The laser gets reflected by the hamster ball and hits Bill in the eye.
Dreamscaperers,Bill,"AAGH! Ah, my eye!AARRGHHH!!"
Dreamscaperers,Narration,"Mabel, Dipper and Soos' hamster ball breaks."
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,"Rise, Xyler! Rise, Craz!"
Dreamscaperers,Narration,Xyler and Craz rise from behind her back with musical instruments. They start to play synthesized music.
Dreamscaperers,Bill,No! Synthesized music! It hurts!
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,And now to imagine your worst nightmare! A portal out of Stan's mind!
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,(Singing:)Out of Stan's mi-ind!
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,"(Whispering:) Mabel! (Shouting:) Everyone, together!"
Dreamscaperers,Narration,The gang all concentrate their thoughts to conjure a crackling vortex below Bill's feet.
Dreamscaperers,Bill,"No, no, no!ENOUGH!!(Wipes the cosmos completely white. The gang all float weightlessly in the void. He becomes yellow again)You know, I'm impressed with you guys. You're a lot more clever than you look. Especially the fat one."
Dreamscaperers,Soos,(Pokes Mabel; in a whisper:)He's talking about you!
Dreamscaperers,Bill,"So I'm gonna let you kids off the hook. You might come in handy later.(in demonic voice)BUT KNOW THIS –(normal voice)A darkness approaches.A daywill come in the future when everything you care about will change! Until then I'll be watching you!I'll be watching you...(Bill disappears, his words echoing)"
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,"He's gone! we did it!(The gang cheers, but they then begin to disappear)Stan must be waking up."
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,(To Xyler and Craz:)Will I ever see you guys again?
Dreamscaperers,Craz,In your dreams.
Dreamscaperers,Xyler,"Good one, bro. Good one."
Dreamscaperers,Narration,"The gang wakes up in the living room, shouting in surprise."
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,We did it!
Dreamscaperers,Stan,What? Did what? What are you all doing here? And why was I dreaming of two brightly colored and radical young men?
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,Grunkle Stan! You're okay!(Hugs Stan)
Dreamscaperers,Stan,"What is this, a hug?"
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,Nope! It's a choke hold.(Chokes Stan)
Dreamscaperers,Narration,Mabel and Soos laughs. Dipper stops choking Stan.
Dreamscaperers,Stan,"(Chuckles)Not bad, kid. Not bad."
Dreamscaperers,Mabel,I'm just glad Gideon didn't get into the safe. I really love this old shack.
Dreamscaperers,Soos,Group hug!(Pause)No? I never know the right time!
Dreamscaperers,Narration,The Shack starts to shake.
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,"Hey, do you guys feel--?"
Dreamscaperers,Narration,An explosion happens behind the sofa.
Dreamscaperers,Gideon,"Oh, I'm sorry, Pines family. Did I wake you?"
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,But... we defeated Bill!
Dreamscaperers,Gideon,Bill failed me! So I switched to plan B: dynamite!
Dreamscaperers,Stan,What? Bill? Who? What are you guys talking about?
Dreamscaperers,Gideon,"Spoiler alert, Stanford! I've got the deed!(Shows the family the deed)The Mystery Shack belongs to me! So get off my property!(By a handheld transceiver:)Daddy? Bring it around the front."
Dreamscaperers,Dipper,"Don't worry, guys! It's just part of the dream! We're gonna wake up any second now! Right? Right?"
Dreamscaperers,Narration,Bud Gleefuldrives a crane with a wrecking ball to the shack. Gideon laughs evilly as the wrecking ball smashes the Mystery Shack's sign.
Dreamscaperers,All,(Screams)
Dreamscaperers,Soos,"Someone pinch me, dude..."
Dreamscaperers,Narration,The broken sign falls in front of the gang.
Dreamscaperers,Narration,"Cut to end credits, slowed down in aTwins Peaksstyle. It says: To Be Continued..."
Gideon Rises,Narration,"The episode opens with a shot ofGravity Falls. Suddenly, a dark shadow covers the entire town all the way to theMystery Shack. The camera cuts to a wrecking ball destroying the Mystery Shack, releasing blue fumes before shortly disappeared.Dippersuddenly wakes up, screams while being sweaty, breathes heavily and sighs."
Gideon Rises,Dipper Pines,"I just had a horrible dream thatGideonstole thedeedto the Mystery Shack, and kicked us out, and...(confused)we all had to move in withSoos' grandma?"
Gideon Rises,Soos Ramirez,"That was no dream, dude."
Gideon Rises,Dipper,(Screams again)
Gideon Rises,Narration,Everyone wakes up.
Gideon Rises,Abuelita,(Turns on the lights and calmly asks Dipper to be quiet)Shh.Por favor.
Gideon Rises,Dipper,"Uh, sorry, Abuelita."
Gideon Rises,Mabel Pines,"Oh, Soos, your grandma is so adorable!(Whispering)And her skin is old lady soft.(Touching her skin)Haaaahhh!"
Gideon Rises,Stan Pines,"(sternly)Mabel, quit being creepy! The news is finally on."
Gideon Rises,Shandra Jimenez,"(On the TV)In a movement that has all of Gravity Falls buzzing, child psychic Gideon Gleeful(shows a picture of a winking Gideon surrounded by a litter of playful puppies)has taken surprise ownership of the Mystery Shack, previously belonging to area shyster, Stanford Pines.(Shows a picture of Stan in a devil costume surrounded by fire)"
Gideon Rises,Stan,(Scratching his back)That picture's taken out of context.
Gideon Rises,Shandra,"Now that you have the shack, what exactly are you planning to do with it?"
Gideon Rises,Gideon Gleeful,"I have a big announcement to make today, and I'd like to cordially invite all the good people of Gravity Falls to join me. Free admission to anyone who wears their Gideon pins! It's my face!(Winks)"
Gideon Rises,Dipper,(feeling guilty)I just can't believe Gideon beat us. Normally I'm able to save the day. This is all my fault.
Gideon Rises,Mabel,"Don't worry, Dipper. Looks like Mabel's going to have to be the hero of the family now. I'll defeat Gideon with mygrappling hook!"
Gideon Rises,Dipper,"(disagreeing)Mabel, no offense, but that grappling hook has literally never helped us once."
Gideon Rises,Mabel,Oh yeah? Jelly grab!
Gideon Rises,Narration,"Mabel shoots her grappling hook at a jar of jelly, causing it to break and splatter jelly on the walls, a painting, porcelain angels, a cupboard, a sofa and half of Abuelita's body."
Gideon Rises,Abuelita,I vacuum the walls now.(Starts vacuuming the wall)
Gideon Rises,Soos,"So you lost the Shack. Look on the bright side, dudes! Now you get to live here with me, Soos! Hey, anyone want to play race cars? They're out of batteries but we can make pretend."
Gideon Rises,Narration,Soos spits out two pieces of food on his belly.
Gideon Rises,Soos,"Would that be a new low if I ate that? Haha I'm just kidding, I'm totally eating it!"
Gideon Rises,Narration,"Soos eats a piece of food from his belly. Cut to Stan, who looks depressed and annoyed by their current situation and then declares..."
Gideon Rises,Stan,We gotta get the Shack back.
Gideon Rises,Narration,Cuts totheme song.
Gideon Rises,Gideon,"Hello, Gravity Falls!"
Gideon Rises,Narration,Cuts to audiences and then cut toToby DeterminedandLazy Susan.
Gideon Rises,Lazy Susan,Gideonis the psychic-est. He guessed the secret ingredient to my coffee omelette!
Gideon Rises,Toby Determined,Somehow he knew about my horrifying secret birthmark!
Gideon Rises,Manly Dan,"I love that child psychic so much!(SqueezesBlubsandDurlandin his bear hug, suffocating them.)"
Gideon Rises,Sheriff Blubs,You're chokin' me!
Gideon Rises,Deputy Durland,"(Turning purple:)Grandma, is that you?"
Gideon Rises,Narration,Camera pans to the Pines and Soos in their disguises.
Gideon Rises,Dipper,We're in.
Gideon Rises,Mabel,"Just wanna say, don't know what we're doing here, but I am loving these fake mustaches."
Gideon Rises,Soos,"If anyone asks, I'm not Soos.(Points to his hat that says ""Not Soos"")"
Gideon Rises,Gideon,Ladies and gentlemen! Today I am delighted to announce my new plans for the former Mystery Shack. I give you... Gideonland!
Gideon Rises,The Pines and Soos,What?!
Gideon Rises,Gideon,"We are gonna turn this dirty ol' shack into three square miles of Gideon-tertainment. And introducin' our new mascot, Lil' Gideon Jr.!"
Gideon Rises,Narration,Bud Gleeful pulls off a cloak to revealWaddlesin a Gideon costume.
Gideon Rises,Gideon,"Boom, he's a pig!"
Gideon Rises,Narration,"Camera cuts to Mabel, who is shocked."
Gideon Rises,Mabel,(horrified)Waddles!(now furious)You monster!
Gideon Rises,Stan,"All right, that's it!(Pulls off disguise)"
Gideon Rises,Narration,The Pines push their way into the crowd and run up the stage.
Gideon Rises,Stan,"Listen up, people. Gideon's a fraud! This kid broke in and stole my property!"
Gideon Rises,Mabel,"Arrest him, officers!"
Gideon Rises,Dipper,Yeah!
Gideon Rises,Gideon,"Such accusations! Mr. Pines, I recall you gave the property to me. Look, here's the deed right here!(He pulls the deed out of his shirt as he says this)"
Gideon Rises,Narration,Camera cuts to Blubs and Durland.
Gideon Rises,Blubs,Well that's all the proof I need to see.
Gideon Rises,Durland,"I love you, Lil' Gideon! Sing them funny songs!"
Gideon Rises,Narration,"Camera cuts to Gideon withtwoburlyguards. Gideon snaps his fingers, and the guards get ready to kick the Pines off the stage. The first grabs a hold of Mabel."
Gideon Rises,Mabel,Hey!
Gideon Rises,Narration,Dipper and Stan are grabbed by the two guards.
Gideon Rises,Gideon,"Now get off my property, old man!(Slaps a Gideon pin on Stan)"
Gideon Rises,Stan,"I'll show you who's the old man!(His hearing aid acts up)Ow, my hearing aid! Ow!"
Gideon Rises,Narration,The Pines get carried off the stage by the guards.
Gideon Rises,Gideon,"Thanks for visiting Gideonland, friends! Don't come back, I don't care for y'all."
Gideon Rises,Narration,Camera cuts to the Pines and Soos as they watch the ceremony through a chain-link fence then sigh as they lean on it. Dipper kicks a rock out of frustration.
Gideon Rises,Dipper,"Don't worry, guys. We'll get the shack back somehow."
Gideon Rises,Narration,Wendyappears.
Gideon Rises,Wendy Corduroy,We better.
Gideon Rises,Dipper,Wendy!
Gideon Rises,Wendy,"(looking gloomy)If I can't work at the Shack, my dad's gonna force me to work upstate at my cousin's logging camp."
Gideon Rises,Dipper,What? You're leaving town? But we need you here!
Gideon Rises,Soos,"Yeah, especially Dipper, because of his giant crush on..."
Gideon Rises,Narration,Dipper glares at Soos.
Gideon Rises,Soos,...You... eucalyptus trees! Ha! The kid loves eucalyptus trees!(Laughs nervously)Saved it!
Gideon Rises,Narration,There's a noise from the bushes.
Gideon Rises,Wendy,"Oh man, guys. Don't look now."
Gideon Rises,Narration,Robbieemerges from the bushes holding a boombox.
Gideon Rises,Robbie,"Take me back, Wendy! My arms are too skinny to keep holding this boombox forever!"
Gideon Rises,Wendy,(Mounts her bike)I was never here.(Rides away)
Gideon Rises,Robbie,(Chases after her)Have you been getting my texts? Do I need to send you more texts? Wendy!
Gideon Rises,Narration,The scene crossfades to Soos' grandmother'shome. Everyone looks forlorn.
Gideon Rises,Abuelita,This is not good. I cannot feed such a big family.
Gideon Rises,Mabel,"Where will we stay, Dipper?(Camera pans out to reveal a suitcase filled with Mabel's sweaters)Where will I put all my sweaters?"
Gideon Rises,Dipper,And what's Stan gonna tellMom and Dad?
Gideon Rises,Soos,Mr. Pines will figure something out.(Pats Dipper with a smile)He always does.
Gideon Rises,Narration,Camera zooms out then cuts to Stan on the phone with Dipper and Mabel's parents.
Gideon Rises,Stan,"Don't worry, your son and daughter are fine. Where're we staying? Uh, I put 'em up in this amazing four-star hotel!"
Gideon Rises,Narration,A cockroach goes up in flames after touching a broken toaster wire.
Gideon Rises,Stan,"(Opens refrigerator)What, uh, sure we got—(shakes a near empty gallon of milk)—plenty to eat.(Closes the fridge)Relax, if I thought I couldn't take care of these kids, I'd send them back right away. Uh huh, you too.(Puts phone down)"
Gideon Rises,Mabel,"(Offscreen:)Grunkle Stan, can we order pizza?"
Gideon Rises,Narration,"Stan checks his pockets only to discover they're empty. Camera cuts to a wider shot of the kitchen and Stan sighs sadly, unsure what to do now."
Gideon Rises,Narration,"Scene switches to the construction of Gideonland. Camera then cuts to a fireplace as a picture of the Pines from ""The Legend of the Gobblewonkeris thrown into it. Gideon is then shown laughing as he examinesbook 2. Meanwhile, Waddles attempts to climb out the window."
Gideon Rises,Gideon,(Blows whistle)Back to your corner!
Gideon Rises,Waddles,Scampers to the corner and starts cringing and shivering.
Gideon Rises,Narration,Bud Gleeful appears with his sad clown painting that Stan stole inThe Hand That Rocks the Mabel.
Gideon Rises,Bud Gleeful,I've been meaning to ask you boy. Shouldn't you be celebratin' Gideonland instead of stickin' your head in that there book all day?
Gideon Rises,Gideon,"Father, have I ever told you the true nature of this book?"
Gideon Rises,Narration,The scene transitions to someone writing Journal 2.
Gideon Rises,Gideon (narrating),It was written many years ago by abrilliant unknown authorwho learned secrets too powerful for one man.
Gideon Rises,Narration,The Author is shown burying the book.
Gideon Rises,Gideon (narrating),He hid his journals where he thought no one would ever find 'em.
Gideon Rises,Narration,"The scene fades to the booksJournal 1andJournal 2coming closer together with Gravity Falls on fire and Gideon in the background. After that it shows the six-fingered hand, but instead of it being gold, it portrays the universe."
Gideon Rises,Gideon (narrating),"Because he knew that if the journals were ever bought together, they would unleash a gateway to unimaginable power."
Gideon Rises,Narration,The scene fades back to Gideon.
Gideon Rises,Gideon,"Codes and maps have led me to believe the other book is buried somewhere on this very property, and I intend to find it!"
Gideon Rises,Bud,So that's why you wanted the Mystery Shack.
Gideon Rises,Narration,The scene shows Gideon with a shovel.
Gideon Rises,Gideon,"That's right, father, it's time to begin the search. For the other journal!"
Gideon Rises,Narration,"The scene fades to Old Man McGucket working on the Gideon-bot, then fades to Dipper, Mabel and Soos."
Gideon Rises,Mabel,Go red car!
Gideon Rises,Soos,Go other red car!
Gideon Rises,Dipper,(bored)This would be a lot more fun with batteries.
Gideon Rises,Narration,Soos moves the red car then it bumps the other red car out of its place.
Gideon Rises,Narration,Stan walks into the room and clears his throat
Gideon Rises,Stan,"Kids, we've got to talk.(The Twins and Soos stand up and listen as Stan speaks.)Look I've been thinking and... I can't take care of you anymore. I don't have house or a job. The plan is, you're goin' home. Your bus leaves tomorrow, here are your tickets.(Takes out two tickets.)"
Gideon Rises,Dipper,"(Protesting)But Grunkle Stan, you can't give up!"
Gideon Rises,Soos,Yeah dude. Look at these faces!
Gideon Rises,Narration,Soos begins nudging Mabel.
Gideon Rises,Soos,"Be cuter, Mabel! Your summer depends on it!"
Gideon Rises,Stan,"Look, I lost, okay? The best thing is for you to be with your parents. I'm sorry, kids, Gideon won.(Places Dipper and Mabel's bus tickets on the table and leaves the house in sadness.)Summer's over."
Gideon Rises,Soos,Mr. Pines! Come back! RECONSIDER!!(Runs after him and closes the door.)
Gideon Rises,Dipper,"Mabel, that's enough. If Stan won't get our home back from Gideon, then we'll have to do it ourselves."
Gideon Rises,Mabel,"Gideon may have the upper hand, but we have one thing he doesn't."
Gideon Rises,Dipper,(Holding out journal)The journal!
Gideon Rises,Mabel,(Holding out grappling hook; Simultaneously:)A grappling hoo- oh. The journal... Journal!
Gideon Rises,Narration,Cut to the outside of the now fenced-off Mystery Shack.
Gideon Rises,Dipper,"Alright, the bus to take us out of Gravity Falls comes at sundown. If we wanna stay in town we've got to get past those guards, make it through the fence, and get Gideon to hand over that deed."
Gideon Rises,Mabel,Leave that to Mabel. Wa-chaw!
Gideon Rises,Narration,"Mabel shoots the grappling hook. It hits a tree branch, then ricochets to Dipper. It hits him in the face."
Gideon Rises,Dipper,Ah!
Gideon Rises,Dipper,Nowwill you admit the grappling hook is useless?!
Gideon Rises,Mabel,Nope!
Gideon Rises,Dipper,Okay. What can we use to defeat Gideon? Let's see... Barf fairy?
Gideon Rises,Mabel,Yeah!
Gideon Rises,Dipper,Nope. Butternut Squash with a Human Face and Emotions?
Gideon Rises,Mabel,Yeah!
Gideon Rises,Dipper,Nope.
Gideon Rises,Mabel,"Whoa, what's this?"
Gideon Rises,Dipper,I've stared at this page for hours. It seems like a blueprint to build some kind of strange futuristic super-weapon--
Gideon Rises,Mabel,BORING! To defeat those guards we need some kind of army.
Gideon Rises,Dipper,"... Wait a minute! An army! Mabel, that's it! Thegnomes!"
Gideon Rises,Mabel,Uhh...(Nervously tugs her sweater's collar)
Gideon Rises,Narration,Cuts to the twins entering theforest.
Gideon Rises,Dipper,I think this is their hiding spot.
Gideon Rises,Mabel,I wonder what Gnomes do out here all alone in the forest?
Gideon Rises,Both,Aaah!
Gideon Rises,Narration,They seeJeffbathing in squirrels.
Gideon Rises,Jeff,Do do do...(sees them)Aah! This... this is normal. This is normal for gnomes. Scrub scrub.(Scrubs his armpit with a squirrel)
Gideon Rises,Dipper and Mabel,"Look at each other disgusted, and look back at Jeff."
Gideon Rises,Jeff,"Well, well, well. Look who came crawlin' back. Take five, Chris.(A squirrel jumps out of the tub)You guys keep doin' what you're doin'. So, changed your mind about marryin' me, did you, Mabel?"
Gideon Rises,Mabel,"Ew, hardly. We need your help. And seriously, ew!"
Gideon Rises,Jeff,You want our help? After you left me at the altar? No dice!
Gideon Rises,Mabel,"Well, what if we were able to get you a new queen? One even more beautiful than me."
Gideon Rises,Dipper,"Her name's Gideon, and she has lovely white hair."
Gideon Rises,Jeff,"Whoa. Mature woman, huh? HeyShmebulock, get my cologne!"
Gideon Rises,Shmebulock,(Comes in)Shmebulock!
Gideon Rises,Jeff,Is Shmebulock all you can say?
Gideon Rises,Shmebulock,(Pauses)Shmebulock...
Gideon Rises,Jeff,It's a deal!(Shakes hands with Dipper)
Gideon Rises,Narration,"Cuts toGreasy's Diner. Stan is seen at the table, ordering something in a very glum tone."
Gideon Rises,Stan,"(Glumly)Waiter, give me a glass of the strongest most expired apple cider you've got."
Gideon Rises,Soos,"Sure thing, Mr. Pines."
Gideon Rises,Stan,"(Looks up and sees Soos, much to his surprise)Soos? What are you doing here?"
Gideon Rises,Soos,"(Cleans glass)Since the Mystery Shack shut down, I've had to take a bunch of part-time jobs. Grave digger, bus driver, really awesome cook... Hey, is the kitchen supposed to have that much fire in it?(The kitchen is in a sea of fire, so Soos runs into kitchen and puts out fire with extinguisher)"
Gideon Rises,Stan,"(Sighs)You're a good man... child, Soos, but it's not lookin' good. This whole town loves Gideon and hates me. If only they knew how evil he really was!(punches the table in anger)"
Gideon Rises,Soos,"(Walks over to Stan, putting his hand on his shoulder)Hey, I'm here for you, dude."
Gideon Rises,Stan,The entire lower half of your body is on fire.
Gideon Rises,Soos,"(Puts his hand on Stan's nose, then pats his arm as smoke emerges from his back)Shh, we're having a moment..."
Gideon Rises,Narration,Cuts to construction at the Mystery Shack.
Gideon Rises,Gideon,"Where are you, Journal?(Gideon takes a shovel and starts to dig)Where are you?!"
Gideon Rises,Bud,"Boy, I hate to interrupt you, but you have some guests."
Gideon Rises,Gideon,What?
Gideon Rises,Dipper,"Give us the deed to the Shack, Gideon, or else!"
Gideon Rises,Gideon,"Am I supposed to say, ""Or else what?""Emphasizes well-built guards behind him"
Gideon Rises,Mabel,"Yes, you are supposed to say that!(Yelling)Now!"
Gideon Rises,Narration,Suddenly an army of gnomes surround Gideon; knock out and tie up guards.
Gideon Rises,Gideon,(Gasps)
Gideon Rises,Dipper,"You're surrounded by an unstoppable gnome army, now give us back our deed and get off our property!"
Gideon Rises,Jeff,And let the marriage ceremony begin!
Gideon Rises,Gideon,(Sighs)Very well. I suppose this deed belongs to—
Gideon Rises,Narration,Gideon pulls out a whistle and blows it and all the gnomes covers their ears.
Gideon Rises,Gideon,Ha! What do you know! Works on gnomes too!(Gideon blows the whistle again)
Gideon Rises,Jeff,"Stop! We'll do anything! How can we serve you, Your Majesty?(Bowing)The most beautiful girl we've ever seen!"
Gideon Rises,Gideon,I am not a girl!
Gideon Rises,Jeff,"Really? But your skin is so soft. You moisturize, or..."
Gideon Rises,Gideon,(Points at Dipper and Mabel)Subdue them!
Gideon Rises,Narration,The gnomes grunt and charge at Dipper and Mabel
Gideon Rises,Gideon,"I have to admit, kids, I am impressed by your creativity! How did you ever..."
Gideon Rises,Dipper,Let go!(Journal 3falls out of Dippers pocket)Oh no!
Gideon Rises,Gideon,No! Could it be? Is it?(Gideon runs up to Journal 3)
Gideon Rises,Gideon,(Laughing)Of course! It all makes sense!(Dipper struggles to break free from the gnomes)The one place I'd never think to look! You had it the whole time! And to think I actually considered you a threat!(Gideon flicks Dipper's nose)
Gideon Rises,Dipper,No! Give it back!(Dipper reaches for the journal)
Gideon Rises,Gideon,Every victory you had was because of your precious book!
Gideon Rises,Dipper,Give it back or I'll—
Gideon Rises,Gideon,"(Interrupting)Or you'll what, boy? You'll what? Huh? Huh? No muscles. No brains. Face it! You're nothin' without this!(Waves)Bye bye forever, y'all!(Whistles, and the gnomes carry Dipper and Mabel away)"
Gideon Rises,Dipper,NOOOOOO!
Gideon Rises,Narration,"The scene ends with Gideon holding 3, andOld Man McGucketworking on theGideon-bot."
Gideon Rises,Narration,"Scene cuts to the gnomes running into the forest, Mabel pacing, and Dipper sitting on the floor."
Gideon Rises,Jeff,"Next time, do your own dirty work! Come on boys!(The squirrels jump into Jeff's pants)"
Gideon Rises,Dipper,"(Sighs)Well, that's it. Guess the bus should be here soon."
Gideon Rises,Mabel,"What? Dipper, don't give up! You always have a plan!"
Gideon Rises,Dipper,"No! The journal always has the plan! Think about it, Mabel, Gideon was right. The only courageous or cool things I've ever done have been because of that journal. Without it, I can't help you, or Stan, or anyone."
Gideon Rises,Mabel,There's gotta be something we can do?
Gideon Rises,Dipper,What can we do?
Gideon Rises,Narration,"The next scene starts with Dipper and Mabel boarding a bus, looking glum."
Gideon Rises,Announcer,"Bus 52, departing Gravity Falls, all aboard."
Gideon Rises,Narration,Dipper and Mabel walk to the back of the bus and look out the window to see Stan.
Gideon Rises,Stan,"Sorry kids, it's for the best."
Gideon Rises,Narration,"The bus leaves with Wendy, Grunkle Stan,GrendaandCandyoutside the window upset and waving at Dipper and Mabel as the bus departs."
Gideon Rises,Dipper,(As he and Mabel look devastated by their loss)Can't believe this is happening.
Gideon Rises,Narration,Camera pans across to a sign reading: Now leaving Gravity Falls. Scene cuts to the construction of GideonLand.
Gideon Rises,Gideon,"(Giggles)I've got it! I finally got it!(Running through the living room, exclaiming at Bud and Mrs. Gleeful)Get out!"
Gideon Rises,Gideon,"It's finally mine! At last, I have journal number...(places 3 on the table)Three?! There areTHREEof them?(moves Journal 3 to the other side of Journal 2)But where is journal numberone?(Thumping table)I must have all three for the power to be unlocked! But where could I— Dipper! He must know where it is! He gave me the third one and he kept the first for himself!(Rips out some of his hair)I can't let him leave Gravity Falls!(Grabs 2 and 3 and runs out of the Mystery Shack)You there!(Points at Old Man McGucket working on the Gideon-Bot)Is it ready?"
Gideon Rises,Old Man McGucket,Heheheh! Only one way to find out!(Pulls lever on Gideon-Bot and the robot glows)
Gideon Rises,Narration,"Gideon runs inside the robot and is in his motion-sensor suit, he then punches his right hand, and the robot pushes the Gideonland sign into the ground. the Gideon-Bot walks away."
Gideon Rises,McGucket,I've got a good feelin' about that kid!
Gideon Rises,Narration,Cut to Soos' house. Soos' grandma is vacuuming the curtains and Stan is sitting on the couch.
Gideon Rises,Stan,"Well Stan, this is it. Rock bottom. No friends, no family, stuck watching infomercials for whatever that is..."
Gideon Rises,Bobby Renzobbi(on TV),Are you sick of piles of owls constantly blocking your drive way? Well then you gotta getowl trowel!
Gideon Rises,Stan,"(Picks up the Gideon pin)How did you do it, kid? Why are you always one step ahead? Maybe he really is psychic after...(His hearing aid acts up)Ah! My hearing aid! What keeps causing that? Wait a minute! That's it! I know Gideon's weakness!"
Gideon Rises,Abuelita,(Brings tea)Would Mr. Pines like a-
Gideon Rises,Narration,Stan kisses Soos' grandma and runs to the door.
Gideon Rises,Abuelita,I go vacuum my face.
Gideon Rises,Narration,Cut to the Pines twins on the bus. Dipper is watching through the glass sadly.
Gideon Rises,Mabel,"Hey, Dipper, wanna play bus seat treasure hunt?"
Gideon Rises,Dipper,I'm not in the mood.
Gideon Rises,Mabel,"Aw, come on!(Lifts a seat)We got Canadian coin, gum that's shaped like Ronald Reagan's head, ooh! Miscellaneous fluid stain?"
Gideon Rises,Dipper,Giant robot!
Gideon Rises,Mabel,"Yeah, giant robot... Wait, what?"
Gideon Rises,Dipper,Look!(Points at the Gideon bot)
Gideon Rises,Narration,Gideon bot runs to the bus yelling.
Gideon Rises,Gideon,Halt! I command you to halt!
Gideon Rises,Dipper and Mabel,(Screams)
Gideon Rises,Narration,Dipper and Mabel run to the bus driver.
Gideon Rises,Mabel,Mr. Bus driver! There is a giant Gideon bot coming towards us!
Gideon Rises,Soos,"Oh hey, dudes!"
Gideon Rises,Dipper and Mabel,Soos!
Gideon Rises,Soos,"Don't worry guys. I've been a part-time bus driver for at least 40 minutes. One of these is probably a clutch...(Pulls the clutch)Hang on, dudes!"
Gideon Rises,Narration,Gideon-bot tries to catch the bus.
Gideon Rises,Mabel,"Soos, look out!"
Gideon Rises,Narration,"Gideon-bot blocks the way with its hand. Soos turns the bus and smashes through a ""Road Closed"" sign. The Gideon-bot starts to climb up the mountain."
Gideon Rises,Dipper,He already won! What does he want from us?
Gideon Rises,Gideon,(Inside the bot)I got you in my sights!
Gideon Rises,Dipper,"Soos, cliff!"
Gideon Rises,Narration,"Soos brakes the bus right before the bus falls off the cliff. The wheel of the bus is not on the cliff so it can't move. The Gideon-bot comes right after and shakes the bus and tears off the ceiling of it, revealing there is only Soos."
Gideon Rises,Soos,"Okay. What's closest to our present situation?(Looking at the ""Bus Emergency Manual"")Raccoon in the engine or angry grandparent won't leave bus?(Pause)Proba-probably the second one."
Gideon Rises,Narration,The Gideon-bot turns itself finding the Pines twins on the bridge. The Pines twins run but soon find that the bridge has dead ends. The Gideon-bot jumps on the bridge.
Gideon Rises,Gideon,Tell me! Where is Journal #1?!
Gideon Rises,Dipper and Mabel,Journal #1?
Gideon Rises,Gideon,"Don't play games with me, boy!"
Gideon Rises,Narration,"The Gideon-bot drives the twins to the end and punches the cliff, causing rocks to fall on the twins."
Gideon Rises,Dipper,I don't know what you're talking about! You took the only journal I ever had! What do you even want with these journals anyway?
Gideon Rises,Narration,The Gideon-bot takes the twins. Mabel resists.
Gideon Rises,Dipper,(Hits the hand of the Gideon-bot)Let go of her!
Gideon Rises,Gideon,"Ha ha ha, you still think you're some kind of hero?(Throws Dipper away)"
Gideon Rises,Narration,Dipper lands on the ground.
Gideon Rises,Gideon,Once I find the final journal I'll rule this town! With you as my queen!(Laughs)
Gideon Rises,Mabel,Dipper! Help me! HELP!
Gideon Rises,Gideon (In Dipper's mind),"Face it kid, you're nothing without that journal. How you gonna fight back? No muscles. No brains. What are you gonna do, huh? What are you gonna do?"
Gideon Rises,Narration,"Dipper sadly walks to the forest... and then jumps off the cliff screaming, breaking into the Gideon-bot's control area and tackling Gideon."
Gideon Rises,Dipper,Let go of my sister!
Gideon Rises,Narration,"The Gideon-bot's head moves, showing that Dipper hit Gideon."
Gideon Rises,Gideon,Never! I've finally won this time!
Gideon Rises,Narration,"It shows the Gideon-bot fighting, which is Gideon's movement inside. Gideon then tackles Dipper and punches him. Dipper stands up and blocks Gideon's punch. Then he makes Gideon's fist to punch himself. Then Dipper makes him punch a little stronger which makes the Gideon-bot's head turn around."
Gideon Rises,Mabel,(Grabbing the thumb)Careful in there!
Gideon Rises,Narration,"The bot wakes a bit then falls off the bridge. Dipper and Mabel falls off from the bot, screaming."
Gideon Rises,Soos,(horrified)Dudes! Nooooooooooo!
Gideon Rises,Narration,"The bot falls on the ground and it causes an explosion big enough for everyone in the town to see. The Gideon-bot is broken, and its pieces are all around. Then something comes down from the top with a string. It was Dipper and Mabel, with her grappling hook."
Gideon Rises,Mabel,GRAPPLING HOOK!!! Told you it would come in handy!
Gideon Rises,Narration,Mabel and Dipper land on the ground safely.
Gideon Rises,Dipper,"Mabel, that was amazing!"
Gideon Rises,Mabel,Not amazing as you defeating that robot!
Gideon Rises,Dipper,Hey! My journal!(Picks up the journal)
Gideon Rises,Narration,The cops come and lots of people starts to gather around.
Gideon Rises,Man,Is this the thing that exploded?
Gideon Rises,Woman,What's going on?
Gideon Rises,Man 2,What is that? It's over here!
Gideon Rises,Narration,Gideon comes out from the Gideon-bot.
Gideon Rises,Deputy Durland,"(Runs to Gideon with Sheriff Blubs, while the crowd looks shocked.)Gideon! Oh, good heavens!(Picks up Gideon, sets him down gently and asks  what happened.)What on earth happened here?"
Gideon Rises,Gideon,It was the Pines twins! They tried to attack me and blew up my statue with dynamite! Arrest 'em!
Gideon Rises,Dipper and Mabel,(shocked)What?
Gideon Rises,Dipper,"Officers, he's lying!"
Gideon Rises,Sheriff Blubs,"Sorry kids, but we trust Gideon. And nothing short of a miracle could ever change our-"
Gideon Rises,Narration,Stan comes in a car screaming.
Gideon Rises,Stan,Wait! Wait! Stop everything! I've got somethin' to say!
Gideon Rises,Blubs,Not this guy again.
Gideon Rises,Stan,"Just wait! Look! You guys all think Gideon is so perfect and honest,(mimicking Gideon in a mocking tone)""Oh! I could never tell a lie! I'm Gideon!"""
Gideon Rises,Blubs,He's more honest than you.
Gideon Rises,Durland,"Yeah, and he's psychic too!"
Gideon Rises,Stan,How'sthisfor psychic? Bam!(Kicks the Gideon-bot; a panel falls off)Take a good look!
Gideon Rises,Narration,Inside of the bot there are many screens showing the Gravity Falls' people.
Gideon Rises,Lazy Susan,"Wait a minute, is thatme?"
Gideon Rises,Lazy Susan (On TV),The secret ingredient to my coffee omelet is coffee!
Gideon Rises,Toby,And me!
Gideon Rises,Doctor(On Tv),I can verify that that birthmark is indeed disgusting.
Gideon Rises,Toby (On TV),Hooray!
Gideon Rises,Crowd,That's me!
Gideon Rises,Stan,That's right; these pins are hidden cameras! And my hearing aid was picking up the feedback! Who's the fraud now?(Breaks the pin revealing there was a camera in the eye of it)
Gideon Rises,Narration,"The people all flung their pins at the ground and stare angrily at Gideon, who laughs nervously. Durland, Manly Dan and several others walk towards Gideon, looking betrayed."
Gideon Rises,Durland,"(Saddened)Gideon, we gave you our trust...!"
Gideon Rises,Manly Dan,(Furious)YouLIEDto us!
Gideon Rises,Gideon,"Please, I... It's not what it looks like! What are you gonna do with me?"
Gideon Rises,Durland,Tyler?
Gideon Rises,Narration,"The camera moves to Tyler, who is next to Gideon. He looks heartbroken by Gideon’s true nature, but says his catchphrase in a very sad tone nonetheless."
Gideon Rises,Tyler,Get 'im...(Wipes tears)Get 'im!
Gideon Rises,Blubs,"Lil' Gideon, you are under arrest for conspiracy, fraud,(sadder tone)and breaking our hearts.(normal tone)Durland, the tiny handcuffs."
Gideon Rises,Narration,Durland puts the tiny handcuffs on Gideon
Gideon Rises,Gideon,Wha- no!
Gideon Rises,Stan,Just one more thing...
Gideon Rises,Gideon,Let go of me! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Gideon Rises,Stan,"I believe this belongs to me.(holds up the deed to the Mystery Shack, hiding Journal 2 behind it)"
Gideon Rises,Gideon,No! No! Watch the hair! You can't do this to me! Y'all are sheep! You need me! I'll be back! You'll hear from my lawyers!
Gideon Rises,Shandra,"There you have it. Local hero Stanford Pines has just exposed Li'l Gideon as a fraud. Anything you have to say to the town, Stanford?"
Gideon Rises,Stan,"The Mystery Shack is back, baby!"
Gideon Rises,Narration,"Cut to inside of the house. Mabel is happily hugging Waddles as his Lil Gideon suit burns in the fire. Then cut to the roof as Dipper, Mabel, Soos and Wendy are fixing the sign. They fix the “S” but it falls again. Cut to the inside of the gift shop which is more successful than ever. Stan is taking money from customers."
Gideon Rises,Stan,"Ahaha! Oh, thank you, thank you!"
Gideon Rises,Narration,"Cut to the twins' attic bedroom, Mabel and Dipper are unpacking."
Gideon Rises,Mabel,"Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow. Hey, Grunkle Stan!"
Gideon Rises,Stan,"Uh, you kiddos settlin' back in okay?"
Gideon Rises,Mabel,"Yep! All of my favorite moldy spots on the ceiling are still there! Even you, Daryl."
Gideon Rises,Dipper,"Hey, Grunkle Stan, me and Mabel have been talking, And I think there's something we should finally tell you."
Gideon Rises,Dipper,"This is a journal I found in the woods.(Dipper hands Stan the journal to peruse)It talks about all the crazy stuff that goes on in Gravity Falls. Gideon nearly destroyed the whole town trying to find it. I don't know what it means, or who wrote it. But, after all we've been through, maybe you should finally know about it."
Gideon Rises,Narration,Stan solemnly closes the book.
Gideon Rises,Stan,"I'm glad you showed me this, Dipper... AHAHAHA! Now I know where you've been getting it all from! Spookums and monsters. This kooky book has been filling your head with crazy conspiracies!"
Gideon Rises,Dipper,But it's all real!
Gideon Rises,Stan,"Haha. You gotta quit readin' this fantasy nonsense for your own good. Although some of these would make great attractions! Can't come up with this stuff! Mind if I borrow this?(Stan gets up, taking the book with him and starts to leave)"
Gideon Rises,Dipper,"Wait, no! Grunkle Stan!"
Gideon Rises,Stan,"""Magic book.""(Laughs)Ridiculous!"
Gideon Rises,Dipper,"Stan, I need it!"
Gideon Rises,Mabel,"Dipper, you don't need that book! Don't you see? On your own you defeated a giant robot with nothing but your bare hands! You're a hero whether you've got that journal or not!"
Gideon Rises,Dipper,"Whoa. Thanks, Mabel. I still want it back though."
Gideon Rises,Mabel,I'm sure you'll get it back. What would a boring old man like Stan want with that book anyway?
Gideon Rises,Soos,(Shoots water guns at Dipper and Mabel and pops out of cardboard box)Soos-ed!
Gideon Rises,Narration,Dipper and Mabel get up and laughingly chase after Soos.
Gideon Rises,Narration,"The camera pans down to the gift shop. Stan enters a code to enter the doorway behind thevending machine. He climbs down a set of stairs to an elevator. He opens a panel besides the elevator and inputs the alchemical symbols for ""composition,"" ""pulverize,"" ""digestion,"" and ""fusion"" followed by the 'down' button. He enters and the elevator and goes to the third floor. Stan exits intoa roomfilled with complex looking machines and sensors. He walks past them to a desk and switchboard. He opens the desk and pulls out a book, revealing it to beJournal #1."
Gideon Rises,Stan,After all these years.
Gideon Rises,Narration,"Stan sets down his journal, Journal #2 (which he had swiped from Gideon when he picked up the deed to the Mystery Shack), and Journal #3."
Gideon Rises,Stan,"Finally, I have them all."
Gideon Rises,Narration,"Stan puts togetherJournals 1, 2, and 3, revealing a complex image algorithm. He confers it as he presses buttons and switches.A machinebeyond the glass of the switchboard lights up."
Gideon Rises,Stan,It's working!
Gideon Rises,Narration,"Stan rushes to the room with the machine and pushes a large lever in front of it. The machine crackles with large bursts of electricity sending beams of light in every direction, and finally turns on completely; a bright, white light emanating from it's central hole, blowing a steady stream of air at Stan. Stan stands proudly in front of it. His hands on his hips, and smiles in satisfaction."
Gideon Rises,Stan,Here we go.
Gideon Rises,Narration,End credits.
Scary-oke,Narration,"The episode starts off in the middle of the night with a massive blue light glowing from inside theMystery Shack. Inside the twins' bedroom they andWaddlesare both sleeping, but Waddles wakes up because of the light. Cut toStanin his secretunderground lablooking at theportal."
Scary-oke,Stan Pines,"Thirty long years and it's all led up to this. My greatest achievement!(Pauses and looks down)Probably should've worn pants.(The machine spouts out some fire that hits Stan in the shoulder and he pats himself on his shoulder to get rid of the fire)Feisty,(smiles)I like it.(Flips switches, looks at readouts)If I finally pull this off, it'll all have been worth it.(Stan sits down in his chair)I just need to keep playing it cool; if anyone ever finds out about this...(He looks at a picture ofDipperandMabel)Yeah, right. I've come this far. Who could possibly catch me now?(He pulls on a six-fingered glove and pulls a switch labeled Max. Power, which powers up the machine, causing a power surge around town, and we cut to a shot ofWendysleeping andGideonin his jail cell noticing the light and opening one eye)"
Scary-oke,Narration,"Cut tothe government base, we see a screen with sound waves.Agent TriggerandAgent Powersare sitting in front of the screen."
Scary-oke,Agent Trigger,See there! There it is again!
Scary-oke,Agent Powers,We haven't seen readings like this for thirty years.
Scary-oke,Trigger,Is it coming from deep space?(Zooms in on screen)An enemy weapon site?(Zooms in several times)
Scary-oke,Powers,Just as I suspected. Gentlemen! We're going toGravity Falls.
Scary-oke,Narration,"Big screen slightly changes to an aerial photo of Gravity Falls, Oregon."
Scary-oke,Narration,Cut totheme song.
Scary-oke,Narration,"Stan's alarm clock wakes him up, he is still in the secret lab."
Scary-oke,Stan,Oh right. Showtime.
Scary-oke,Narration,Cut toMystery Shack.
Scary-oke,Stan,"Welcome, to the grand re-opening of the Mystery Shack!"
Scary-oke,Narration,Touristscheer for Stan.
Scary-oke,Stan,We're here to celebrate the defeat of that skunk Li'l Gideon!(Grabs a Li'l Gideon doll)
Scary-oke,Tourists,Boo!
Scary-oke,Stan,"Please, please... boo harder!(Gestures)"
Scary-oke,Tourists,BOO!
Scary-oke,Stan,But I didn't catch that porkchop all alone. These two scamps deserve SOME of the glory(Playfully rubs Dipper's hat)
Scary-oke,Narration,Mabel elbows Stan.
Scary-oke,Stan,"Okay, okay. Most of the glory."
Scary-oke,Toby Determined,(Holds up cinder block painted to look like a camera)Smile for the camera!
Scary-oke,Stan,"Your camera's a cinder block, Toby."
Scary-oke,Toby,I just wanna be a part of things...
Scary-oke,Shandra Jimenez,Smile for a REAL camera.
Scary-oke,Mabel Pines,"Everyone say ""Something stupid!"""
Scary-oke,"Mabel, Stan and Dipper Pines","(Mabel pokes her fingers in her cheeks, Stan puts on some jazz hands, and Dipper pretends to choke himself)Something stupid!"
Scary-oke,Stan,And don't forget to come to theafter-partytonight at eight.(Shows After-Party poster)
Scary-oke,Mabel,"We're doing a karaoke bonanza, people!(Grabs karaoke machine)Light! Music! Enchantment!(Blows confetti out of her hand)And an amazing karaoke performance by our family band,Love Patrol Alpha!"
Scary-oke,Dipper,I don't know about that.
Scary-oke,Stan,I would never agree to that ever.
Scary-oke,Mabel,Too late! I wrote your names on the list! It's happening!
Scary-oke,Wendy Corduroy,"(Blows an air horn)Buy a ticket, people! You know you don't have anything else going on in your lives! I'm talking to you,Pizza Guy! Don't lame out on me!"
Scary-oke,Narration,"Tourists follow Wendy outside. Cut to Stan, Dipper and Mabel."
Scary-oke,Stan,"(Sighs)The town loves us, we finally got that Gideon smell out of the carpet. Everything is finally going my way."
Scary-oke,Dipper,"Hey, Grunkle Stan. Now that we have a moment. I've been meaning to ask you for myjournalback."
Scary-oke,Stan,"Wha? Journal?(""Searches"" himself for the journal, pulling it from under the counter)Oh!(Laughs)You mean this old thing! It was so boring I couldn't even finish it."
Scary-oke,Narration,"Flashback in Stan's office, Stan photocopies Journal 3. Waddles is standing beside thecopy machine."
Scary-oke,Waddles,(Squeals)
Scary-oke,Stan,(Points at Waddles)You didn't see nothing!
Scary-oke,Narration,Cut back to present.
Scary-oke,Dipper,"Wait, you're just gonna give it to me? Just like that?"
Scary-oke,Stan,What else do you want? A kiss on the cheek?
Scary-oke,Dipper,I... I gotta go!(Takes Mabel with him to the attic)
Scary-oke,Soos Ramirez,I wouldn't mind a kiss on the cheek.
Scary-oke,Stan,Not gonna happen.
Scary-oke,Narration,"Cut to attic. Dipper locks the door, turns Mabel's stuffed animals around, pulls down the screen on the window and turns on his electric lamp."
Scary-oke,Dipper,"Mabel, we've gotta talk. Almost losing my journal made me realize that I'm halfway through the summer, and still no closer to figuring out the big mysteries of Gravity Falls. Gideon almost destroyed the town to get his hands on this journal. But why?(Starts pacing up and down the room)Who wrote it? Where are all the other journals? What wasBilltalking about when he said ""everything was going to change""? There's something HUGE going on right under our noses. And it's time we stop goofing around and get to the bottom of it."
Scary-oke,Mabel,"Bro, you've looked at that thing like, a bazillion times. There's nothing left to discover! Half the pages are blank, remember?"
Scary-oke,Dipper,(While flipping through pages of Journal 3:)I just feel like I'm one puzzle piece away from figuring out everything.
Scary-oke,Mabel,"Don't worry, Dipper!(Lifts up Waddles)Lord Mystery Ham is on the case!(In British accent, pretending to be Waddles:)""I play by me own rules! Wot? Wot?"""
Scary-oke,Dipper,I don't know why I tell you things...do you hear that?
Scary-oke,Narration,Cut to the Mystery Shack parking lot. A car parks. Two men step out of the car and look at the Shack.
Scary-oke,Soos,"Hey, Mr. Pines, what's that code word I'm supposed to yell when I see agovernment vehicle?"
Scary-oke,Stan,"Wait, what?(Stan goes near Soos and looks outside the window too)Government vehicle?"
Scary-oke,Narration,"(A ""U.S. Government"" vehicle arrives near the Mystery Shack, a ""USEXEMPT"" is on the vehicle's number-plate, and a sticker that says ""Honk If You Want To Be Arrested"" is on the back of the car. Stan, with a scared look on his face, quickly closes the window, goes to the Mystery Shack's intercom and screams into it)"
Scary-oke,Stan,"(From the Mystery Shack's speaker:)The Mystery Shack is now closed, everybody out! I will not hesitate to use the hose on the elderly!"
Scary-oke,Narration,Mabel and Dipper run to Stan while all the customers are leaving the gift shop.
Scary-oke,Mabel,"Grunkle Stan, what's happening?"
Scary-oke,Dipper,"Yeah, you never shut down the gift shop."
Scary-oke,Narration,"Stan is walking nervously in the gift shop, a door bell ring is heard and a few knocks after it."
Scary-oke,Stan,"(Opens the door with a big smile)Welcome to the Mystery Shack, gentlemen! What can I get you?(Stan takes out a snow globe and an U.F.O key chain of his jacket)Key chains? Snow globes? These rare photos of American presidents?(Stan pulls a five dollar bill out of his sleeve as he begins to sweat)"
Scary-oke,Narration,"Two men are shown standing in the doorway in front of Stan, showing their government I.D. cards."
Scary-oke,Powers,My name is Agent Powers. This is Agent Trigger. We're here to investigate reports of mysterious activity in this town.
Scary-oke,Trigger,(Points at Stan)Activity!
Scary-oke,Stan,Mysterious activity? In the Mystery Shack? You gotta be joking!
Scary-oke,Powers,I assure you I am not. I was born with a rare disorder that makes me physically incapable of experiencing humor.
Scary-oke,Stan,(Laughs nervously)
Scary-oke,Powers,"I don't understand that sound you're making with your mouth. Now if you'll excuse us, we're conducting an investigation."
Scary-oke,Narration,Both men enter the Mystery Shack.
Scary-oke,Trigger,(Pokes Stan menacingly)Investigation!
Scary-oke,Dipper,"Wait! Wait, did you guys say you're investigating the mysteries of this town?"
Scary-oke,Powers,"That information is classified(kneels down), but yes. Look, between you and me, I believe there is a conspiracy of paranormal origin all connected to this town.(Close-up)We're just one small lead away from blowing the lid off this entire mystery."
Scary-oke,Dipper,"Are you kidding me? I'm investigating the exact same thing! I found this journal in the woods which has almost all the answers. If we work together, we could crack the case!"
Scary-oke,Powers,"(Checks Agent Trigger)If you have evidence of these claim,(gives Dipper his card)we should talk."
Scary-oke,Dipper,We could talk right now! Please please. C-Come in! I have so much to show you!
Scary-oke,Stan,"Hehe, I'm sorry, agents. Kid has an overactive imagination. And like, a sweating problem."
Scary-oke,Mabel,(Off screen:)Haha! Zing!
Scary-oke,Stan,"Paranormal town stuff is just part of gift shop lore. Sells more tickets, you know?(Snaps fingers)"
Scary-oke,Soos,"Popodopopo! Swag!(Sticks ""What is the Mystery Shack?"" bumper stickers to both agents and puts some funny antennae on their heads)"
Scary-oke,Powers,We have other spots to investigate. We'll be on our way.
Scary-oke,Trigger,(Takes ten Stan bobbleheads)I'm confiscating this for evidence.
Scary-oke,Agent Powers,Smart move.
Scary-oke,Dipper,"(Runs)Wait! No, wait! We have so much to talk about!"
Scary-oke,Stan,"(Stops Dipper)Hold it kiddo. Trust me, the last thing you want around during a party is cops.(Closesvending machinewith his back)I'm confiscating that card.(Takes card from Dipper)"
Scary-oke,Dipper,(Gasps)
Scary-oke,Stan,"Now how's about you go be a normal kid? Flirt with a girl, or steal a pie off a windowsill.(Puts card in ""Contraband Box"" and walks into the living room)"
Scary-oke,Dipper,But Grunkle Stan! You don't understand!
Scary-oke,Stan,And don't go talking to those agents.
Scary-oke,Dipper,Ugh! That could've been my big break!
Scary-oke,Mabel,"(Takes journal)Bro, maybe Grunkle Stan is right. We're throwing a party tonight! Can't you go one night without searching for aliens or raising the dead or whatever?"
Scary-oke,Dipper,I'm not gonna raise the dead. I just need a chance to show those agents my book!
Scary-oke,Mabel,"Trust me Dipper, the only book you'll need tonight is right here: Boop!(Shows him her ""Karaoke Songs"" book)"
Scary-oke,Dipper,(Holds book)
Scary-oke,Mabel,"I say kara–, you say –oke! Kara–(raises her arms), kara–(raises her arms), kara–(raises her arms). I could do this all day."
Scary-oke,Narration,"Cut to party, Soos places a nacho bowl, Mabel stands on the podium while Stan walks to the Shack."
Scary-oke,Stan,(Gets shot by Mabel's confetti cannon)Aah!
Scary-oke,Mabel,"Well, the confetti cannon works!(Gasps)And the karaoke machine has all the best songs!(Reads aloud)""We Built This Township on Rock and Roll,"" ""Danger Lane to Highway Town,"" ""Taking Over Midnight"" by &ndra!(Grabs microphone)"
Scary-oke,Stan,"Listen kid, you do not want to hear this voice singing. Trust me."
Scary-oke,Mabel,"Grunkle Stan, karaoke isn't about sounding good, it's about sounding terrible, TOGETHER.(Big eyes)"
Scary-oke,Wendy,"(Laughs; to Dipper:)Check it out! These black lights make my teeth look scary.(Turns on black light)It's like a crime scene in my mouth! C'mon, you love it."
Scary-oke,Dipper,"(Sighs)It's not fair. Finally I meet someone who can help me solve the mysteries of this town, and Stan confiscates their card."
Scary-oke,Wendy,"Dude, I probably shouldn't be telling you this, but I'm pretty sure Stan hides, like, everything in his room."
Scary-oke,Dipper,"Ugh, if I go into Stan's room I could get in so much trouble."
Scary-oke,Wendy,"Yeah, you're probably right. That's what makes it fun, dummy!(Puts party hat on Dipper's head)"
Scary-oke,Narration,Cut to Soos stacking Piñatas shaped like Grunkle Stan's head.
Scary-oke,Soos,"Man, I can't wait to smash theseStañatas!"
Scary-oke,Grenda Grendinator,"Smash!(Dives into the Stañatas, breaking them and the table they are on)Grenda has entered the party!"
Scary-oke,Candy Chiu,(Picking up candy from the destroyed Stañatas)Stan's brains look delicious.
Scary-oke,Mabel,Girls!(Hugs Candy and Grenda)
Scary-oke,Grenda,"Omigosh! Omigosh, Mabel! Is that a boombox sweater?"
Scary-oke,Mabel,See for yourself!
Scary-oke,Grenda,Poke!(Pokes the boombox on Mabel's sweater)
Scary-oke,Narration,The boombox starts flashing and music plays. The three girls start dancing.
Scary-oke,Grenda,"(While dancing:)Ha! Ha! Yes, work it! Hah!"
Scary-oke,Narration,"Cut to the Mystery Shack's parking lot as some vehicles pull in.Gompersis standing on the ""Mystery Shack"" sign.Thompson,Tambry,NateandLeeare walking towards the party."
Scary-oke,Thompson,"Aw, I thought this was gonna be a rave."
Scary-oke,Nate,"Thompson, take off your shirt and make it a rave!"
Scary-oke,Thompson,(While taking shirt off)I'll do anything for your approval!
Scary-oke,Tambry,(Takes a picture of shirtless Thompson with her phone)
Scary-oke,Thompson,"Aw, come on."
Scary-oke,Tambry,"I promise I won't send it to anyone.(Presses ""SEND ALL"" button on her phone)"
Scary-oke,Narration,"Cut to Stan at a table with ""ADMISSION $10"" written on the front."
Scary-oke,Lazy Susan,(Walks past and hands Stan some money while carrying a pie)Who's got one good eye and one good pie?
Scary-oke,Manly Dan,"(Walks past and hands Stan money while carrying two kegs with ""MEAT"" written on them)These kegs are full of MEAT!"
Scary-oke,Tyler Cutebiker,(Walks past and hands Stan money while looking at his phone and laughing)Tambry sends me the craziest texts!
Scary-oke,Stan,"The whole town is showing up! And no sign of those pesky agents. Wendy, Dipper. How are those posters coming along?(Looks at where Dipper and Wendy were, notices they're gone, and frowns)Hmm."
Scary-oke,Narration,"Cut to the door of Stan's room. A piece of wood nailed to the door reads ""STAN'S ROOM."" A sign hanging on a nail below it reads ""NO MINORS ALLOWED."" A picture of Dipper with a cross through it and ""THAT MEANS YOU!"" written on it is pinned to the door. A ""Do not disturb"" sign is on the doorknob."
Scary-oke,Wendy,I'll keep an eye out for Stan. You go rustle through his weird old man biz.
Scary-oke,Dipper,"(Opens door and walks into Stan's room)Alright, Grunkle Stan. Where did you hide that card?(Opens drawer withGold Chains For Old Men Magazineand other items)Nothing.(Opens closet)Nothing.(Opens drawer with knuckledusters and boxing gloves)Nothing.(Opens chest containing Fully Clothed Women magazine and Lady Swimwear magazine)Ew! Pretending I never saw that.(Ends up in front of a portrait of Stan)Wait a minute...(Moves portrait to reveal a secret compartment with a box labelled ""Contraband"" in it)Haha, yes!(Takes out box and pulls out Agent Powers' card)I got it!(Picks up the phone and dials the number on the card)"
Scary-oke,Powers,(Through phone:)Agent Powers.
Scary-oke,Dipper,"Hi, this is Dipper. Th-The kid from the Mystery Shack. The one with the, um, ""sweating problem."" I have that journal I wanted to show you!"
Scary-oke,Powers,"(Through phone:)And you're certain this ""journal"" will help our case?"
Scary-oke,Dipper,I'm a hundred percent positive.
Scary-oke,Powers,(Through phone:)Very well. We're on our way.
Scary-oke,Narration,Stan appears and presses a button to end the phone call.
Scary-oke,Dipper,(Gasps)
Scary-oke,Wendy,"Sorry, Dipper.(Shows her phone with the picture of shirtless Thompson on it)I got distracted."
Scary-oke,Stan,"Kid, why did you call those agents? I've told you once, I've told you a hundred times!(Grabs phone from Dipper)There's nothing ""supernatural"" going on in Gravity Falls.(Hangs up phone)"
Scary-oke,Dipper,"Yes, there is! After everything that's happened youhaveto know that by now."
Scary-oke,Stan,"All I know is that your dumb obsession is gonna get us all in trouble one of these days. Now go enjoy the rest of the party, 'cause when it's over – you're grounded."
Scary-oke,Narration,Dipper and Wendy walk away. Dipper looks at Stan angrily.
Scary-oke,Stan,(Sighs)
Scary-oke,Narration,"Cut to the vending machine. Stan enters the code, goes inside it, then checks to see if anyone is watching before closing it behind him."
Scary-oke,Narration,"Cut to the party, Mabel walks from left to right."
Scary-oke,Mabel,"(To unnamed kids andrich boy:)Hey boys! Looking good!(ToGorney:)Gorney! You clean up nice! (ToMr. Poolcheck:) Mr. Poolcheck, move those crazy legs.(Softly:)You-you weird pool man. (ToSheriff BlubsandDeputy Durland:) What's the problem, officers? Did you catch my face going ninety smiles per hour?"
Scary-oke,Durland,We've got complaints about the loudest party in town.
Scary-oke,Blubs,Three words: We want in.
Scary-oke,Mabel,(Lifts up party horns and put them in Durland and Blubs' mouths; whispers:)Welcome to your dreams!
Scary-oke,Blubs and Durland,(Blow party horns)
Scary-oke,Narration,"Cut to Mystery Shack parking lane, the government vehicle from earlier appears. Agent Trigger and Agent Powers get out of it. They look at their watches."
Scary-oke,Dipper,"Guys, I'm so glad to see you. Working together, we can crack all the big questions of Gravity Falls!(Agents look at each other)Trust me, this book is the lead you've been looking for.(Gives book to Agents, they start reading)I'm thinking full scale investigation. Forensics, researchers. Do you guys have a helicopter?(Chuckles)I'm sorry, ""helicopters."""
Scary-oke,Powers,"Kid, I'd love to believe you, but this just looks like more junk from your uncle's gift shop.(Points backwards)I mean,Leprecorn? I can't be the only one that thinks that it's not funny."
Scary-oke,Trigger,I can confirm.(Nods his head)Not funny.
Scary-oke,Dipper,"No, no, no! It's real, I swear! You should ""send it to the lab."" Am I saying that right?"
Scary-oke,Powers,"(Hands Dipper back the journal)Your uncle was right about that overactive imagination. We've got paperwork to do, kid."
Scary-oke,Trigger,Boring. Paperwork.
Scary-oke,Dipper,"WAIT! This book is real.(Flipping through pages)Gnomes, cursed objects, spells! LISTEN! Uh, uh,Corpus Levitas! Diablo Dominus! MONDO VICIUM!"
Scary-oke,Narration,"""Vicium"" echos through the air, as a large gust builds up. The ground starts shaking."
Scary-oke,Dipper,Huh?
Scary-oke,Both Agents,AAH!
Scary-oke,Narration,A huge crack forms between Dipper's feet he jumps away and lands near the Agents. Green smoke comes out of the crack. A zombie slowly climbs out and roars.
Scary-oke,Dipper,"Ha, a zombie! A real, actual, zombie. See? Spooky journal, 100% real. Now can we work together?"
Scary-oke,Powers,Mother of all that is holy!
Scary-oke,Trigger,What do we do?
Scary-oke,Dipper,"It's just one zombie. Trust me, I see stuff like thisallthe time"
Scary-oke,Narration,"Dipper scans trough his journal, looking for a solution. Then after a few seconds the zombie roars in his face about to bite him."
Scary-oke,Dipper,(Screams)
Scary-oke,Narration,"Agent Powers quickly hits the zombie with a rock, knocking it out."
Scary-oke,Dipper,"Whew. Oh, good thing it was just that one."
Scary-oke,Narration,"The ground starts shaking again more cracks form, more green smoke, and suddenly dozens of zombies appear and start going after Dipper, Agent Trigger, and Agent Powers."
Scary-oke,Dipper,"Oh my gosh! You guys can help, right?!"
Scary-oke,Powers,"Kid, we've been chasing the paranormal for years,but we've never seen anything like this before!"
Scary-oke,Trigger,Get down!(Zombies tackle them)
Scary-oke,Narration,"Dipper screams as he sees the zombies pull the screaming agents into the darkness of the forest, leaving him by himself."
Scary-oke,Dipper,"Oh, my gosh, WHAT HAVE I DONE?!"
Scary-oke,Narration,"Cuts to the party were everyone is happy, dancing, and having a good time. Then show the police rapping."
Scary-oke,Blubs,"(Singing karaoke:)What up, fools. It's Blubs and Durls."
Scary-oke,Deputy Durland,(Singing karaoke:)Making all that money and gettin' them girls!
Scary-oke,Blubs and Durland,WOOOOOO!
Scary-oke,Mabel,"(Talking to the dancing crowd of the party:)What do you say, guys? Is this party legendary? When I say ""Mabel,"" you say ""Pines""!"
Scary-oke,Narration,The ground starts shaking.
Scary-oke,Mabel,Mabel!
Scary-oke,Woman,(Screams)
Scary-oke,Mabel,Mabel!
Scary-oke,Man,WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE!!
Scary-oke,Mabel,Why does that never work?
Scary-oke,Wendy,"Whoa, whoa! I think it's an earthquake!(Blows airhorn)Hey, everybody, we got to get out of here!"
Scary-oke,Candy,We are all doomed!
Scary-oke,Grenda,"Quick, into my getaway pouch."
Scary-oke,Narration,Candy jumps into Grenda's backpack.
Scary-oke,Grenda,"Mabel, escape while you still can!"
Scary-oke,Mabel,"Wait, no! Don't leave! We haven't even done our family karaoke song yet!"
Scary-oke,Narration,Dipper runs into the party (Soos and Mabel are the only ones left). Mabel notices the zombies following Dipper.
Scary-oke,Mabel,"(Very annoyed:)Dipper, what's the one thing I asked you not to do tonight?"
Scary-oke,Dipper,(Sounding ashamed:)Raise the dead.
Scary-oke,Mabel,And what did you do?
Scary-oke,Dipper,Raise the dead.
Scary-oke,Narration,"As the zombies get closer, Mabel and Dipper back up as Soos heroically steps in front to protect them."
Scary-oke,Soos,"Get back, dudes. This is about to get intense."
Scary-oke,Narration,"Zombie knocks over a table, forcing them into a dead end, as the zombies surround them"
Scary-oke,All,(Scream)
Scary-oke,Soos,"Sorry, one second.(Takes out his phone and takes a picture)You got to admit this is pretty cool."
Scary-oke,Narration,(Commercial break)
Scary-oke,Dipper,ZOMBIES!!
Scary-oke,Mabel,Don't panic. Maybe they're just a really ugly flash mob?!
Scary-oke,Narration,A zombie swings and almost hits their heads before they duck. They run behind Soos while screaming.
Scary-oke,Soos,"Dudes, stay calm. I've been training for this moment my whole life. With all the horror movies I've seen, I know literally everything there is to know about how to avoid zombies."
Scary-oke,Narration,"A zombie bites Soos, and he becomes a zombie."
Scary-oke,Soos,"Second thought, gonna flip the script. Can I, eat your brains? Yea or Nay? Seeing some Yea faces over here."
Scary-oke,Dipper and Mabel,(Scream)
Scary-oke,Narration,"They run around the side of the house, Soos and the other zombies in slow pursuit. Dipper slices through a zombie with his shovel."
Scary-oke,Dipper,Quick! The golf cart!
Scary-oke,Narration,"Zombies attack the golf cart, tipping it over and biting at it."
Scary-oke,Dipper,"Aw, come on!"
Scary-oke,Soos,"Hoo, that's a bummer. Good news for me though, ha ha."
Scary-oke,Dipper,Soos!
Scary-oke,Soos,"Sorry, dude, I just really want those brains!"
Scary-oke,Dipper,Stay back!
Scary-oke,Narration,"Dipper hits a colorful disco ball at the zombies. One of the zombies catches it in its mouth and swallows it, sending rays of colorful light shining out between its ribs. They continue advancing toward the twins, who stand in fear."
Scary-oke,Soos,"Give it up, dudes! Your fighting only makes us look more rad!"
Scary-oke,Mabel,What do we do? Where's Grunkle Stan?
Scary-oke,Dipper,How's he supposed to help? He doesn't even believe in the supernatural!
Scary-oke,Narration,"Cut to the secret lab, the portal glowing and making a zapping noise. Stan is in his chair, pushing buttons."
Scary-oke,Stan,"Those agents could ruin everything. Darn kid! He has no idea what he's messing with.(He picks upJournal 1)He's stubborn, that's his problem.(Looks at his face reflected in the cover)Sorta like me, I suppose.(Puts the journal down)Ugh, I got too much on my mind to worry about those kids right now. All right, let's see..."
Scary-oke,Narration,"A screen behind him shows Dipper, Mabel, and Waddles running from the zombies. Cut to outside. A zombie pops up in front of the twins."
Scary-oke,Mabel,"Take that, sucka!(She hits the zombie with the karaoke machine. Its head flies off)This thing's a surprisingly good weapon!"
Scary-oke,Narration,More zombies approach behind them. The kids scream and run into the Shack.
Scary-oke,Dipper,Quick! We need to board up all the windows!
Scary-oke,Narration,"They pile things in front of the door, blocking it. The zombies press against the door and begin to break it."
Scary-oke,Dipper,"(While backing up:)Okay, maybe that'll hold 'em."
Scary-oke,Narration,The window crashes open. Soos leans in.
Scary-oke,Soos,"Hey dudes! By the way, I taught the zombies how to get to the fuse box. Among these dudes, I'm like a genius, haha!"
Scary-oke,Narration,"The Shack lights go out, with red light pouring in from outside. Zombies start climbing in through the window."
Scary-oke,Soos,"Get those brains, dawg!"
Scary-oke,Dipper,"(Runs for the other door, just as a zombie hand smashes through. He gasps and backs into the corner with Mabel)"
Scary-oke,Mabel,"Dipper, isn't there something in the journal about defeating zombies?!"
Scary-oke,Dipper,"(Frantically looking through the journal:)NO! THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE ABOUT WEAKNESSES!(Sighs)This can't be happening. I wanted answers so bad I put everyone in danger. Now we're toast, it's all my fault, and no one can save us!"
Scary-oke,Narration,A zombie grabs Dipper's arm and lifts him up. Mabel screams.
Scary-oke,Dipper,"Ah, NO! MABEL, I'M SORRY!"
Scary-oke,Mabel,DIPPER!
Scary-oke,Narration,"Dipper screams, the zombie opens it's mouth, when suddenly—""SMASH!""—it is hit with a baseball bat and drops Dipper, and its head is crushed by the foot of—"
Scary-oke,Stan,"(Standing in a heroic stance, panting, his clothes torn and hat gone. Gesturing to the twins:)YOU TWO! ATTIC! NOW!"
Scary-oke,Dipper,Grunkle- Grunkle Stan?!
Scary-oke,Stan,"I said NOW!(As Dipper, Mabel, and Waddles flee and the zombies approach:)All right, you undead jerks, YOU READY TO DIE TWICE?!"
Scary-oke,Narration,"The twins run through the living room, Stan following, fighting off zombies."
Scary-oke,Stan,The only wrinkly monster who harasses my family is me! Take that! And that!
Scary-oke,Stan,"Eat it, no eyes!(A zombie growls and bites the baseball bat in half, only be punched by Stan's brass-knuckle-wearing fists)ANYONE ELSE WANNA PIECE?!"
Scary-oke,Narration,"He continues bashing zombies, then backs up the stairs as more enter from the front door. At the top of the stairs he pushes over a grandfather clock with a grunt, sending it tumbling into the horde of zombies. The twins run into their room and slam the door. They back away as something starts breaking in. The door opens to reveal Stan, who coughs and clutches his side."
Scary-oke,Stan,"Oh! Ow. Everything hurts.(He turns and closes the door, barricading it with a chair)"
Scary-oke,Dipper,"Grunkle Stan, that was amazing! Are you alright! Heh heh, well, at least you can't deny magic exists anymore, right?"
Scary-oke,Stan,"(Pause)Kid, I've always known."
Scary-oke,Dipper,"Wait, what are you talking about?"
Scary-oke,Stan,"I'm not an idiot, Dipper! Of course this town is weird! And the one thing I know about that weirdness is that it's dangerous!(A zombie's hand breaks through the door. The group backs into the center of the room)I've been lying about it to try to keep you away from it. To try to protect you from it!"
Scary-oke,Narration,"A zombie breaks through the window. Stan punches it and watches it fall to the ground, where a crowd of zombies is staring up at the Shack. More start crawling up the outside walls."
Scary-oke,Stan,It looks like I didn't lie well enough.
Scary-oke,Mabel,"What do we do, what do we do?"
Scary-oke,Dipper,"(Pacing across the room)Well, normally the journal would help us, but there's nothing in there about defeating zombies!(He pauses by a black light, and it glows on the journal, revealing glowing text)It's hopeless!"
Scary-oke,Mabel,"Wait, wait, wait! The text! It's glowing in the black light!"
Scary-oke,Dipper,"What?(He flips through the journal, with Mabel and Grunkle Stan watching. The pages are covered with previously hidden notes)All this time I thought I knew all the journal's secrets, but they're written in some kind of invisible ink!"
Scary-oke,Stan,(Apparently not knowing about this before)Invisible ink?
Scary-oke,Dipper,"This is it!(Reading:)""Zombies have a weakness! Previously thought to be invincible, their skulls can be shattered by a perfect three part harmony."" Three part harmony, how can we create that? I have a naturally high-pitched scream...?"
Scary-oke,Stan,I can make noises with my body? Sometimes intentionally.
Scary-oke,Mabel,"Boys, boys. I think you're both missing the obvious solution."
Scary-oke,Narration,"Cut to the zombies outside crowding the Mystery Shack. They wander through the gift shop, when a noise comes from a microphone."
Scary-oke,Mabel,(Through mic:)Hello? Hello? Is this thing on?
Scary-oke,Narration,The zombies start walking outside. Soos walks through the living room.
Scary-oke,Soos,"(Notices TV)Ooh,Gossiping Housewivesis on!(He sits to watch. A zombie calls him from outside)Eh, I already sat down."
Scary-oke,Narration,"The zombies gather outside. Dipper, Grunkle Stan, and Mabel are on the roof awning, each holding a microphone."
Scary-oke,Mabel,"Zombies and gentlemen! I'm Mabel, they're Dipper and Stan, and together we're Love Patrol Alpha!"
Scary-oke,Dipper,I never agreed to that name.
Scary-oke,Mabel,Hit it!
Scary-oke,Narration,"""Taking Over Midnight"" starts playing."
Scary-oke,Stan,"(Looks at lyrics)Uh, Mabel, our lives may not be worth this."
Scary-oke,Dipper,"(Singing:)""Friday night, and we're gonna party 'til dawn. Don't worry, Daddy,(questioningly)I've got my favorite dress on?!""(Covers mic)Mabel, this is stupid!"
Scary-oke,Mabel,"(Singing:)""Roll in to the party, the boys are lookin' our way. We just keep dancin', we don't care what they say!""(Zombies start crawling up the roof)""And all the boys are gettin' up in my face–""(A zombie grabs at them)Aah! Guys, we have to sing together or it won't work!"
Scary-oke,Stan,"(Singing:)""Boys are a bore, let's show 'em the door."""
Scary-oke,All three,"(Singing:)""We're takin' over the dance floor! Oh-oh! Girls do what we like!"""
Scary-oke,Narration,"A sound wave goes out, causing the zombies to cover their ears. A few of their heads explode."
Scary-oke,All three,"(Singing:)""Oh-oh! We're taking over tonight! Oh-oh! Girls do what we like! Oh-oh! We're taking over tonight!"""
Scary-oke,Narration,They sing to the night as more zombies' heads explode.
Scary-oke,All three,"(Singing:)""We're queens of the disco! Oh-oh! Girls do what we like! Oh-oh! We're taking over tonight!"""
Scary-oke,Dipper,"(Singing:)""Takin' over tooniiiiight!"""
Scary-oke,Narration,"As the guitar riff plays, a zombie pops up and Dipper screams."
Scary-oke,Mabel,DUCK!(Shoots it with confetti cannon. Its head lands in the punch bowl as the rising sun illuminates the corpses of all the zombies)Thank you! We'll be here all night!
Scary-oke,Stan,"Deal with it, zombie idiots!(Laughs maniacally)"
Scary-oke,All,(Chant:)PINES! PINES! PINES! PINES!
Scary-oke,Narration,Cut to the ravaged living room. Stan puts on his fez.
Scary-oke,Dipper,"I'm sorry about this, guys. I totally ruined everything."
Scary-oke,Mabel,"Dipper, are you kidding me? I got to sing karaoke with my two favorite people in the world! No party could ever top that."
Scary-oke,Stan,"Kids, listen. This town is crazy. So you need to be careful. I don't know what I'd do with myself if you got hurt on my watch. I'll let you hold on to that spooky journal, as long as you promise me you'll only use it for self-defense, and not go looking for trouble."
Scary-oke,Dipper,"Okay, as long as you promise me that you don't have any other bombshell secrets about this town."
Scary-oke,Stan,(Crosses his fingers behind his back)Promise.
Scary-oke,Dipper,(Crosses his fingers behind his back as well) Promise.
Scary-oke,Stan,"Man, we have got a lot of zombie damage to clean up. Where's my handyman anyway?"
Scary-oke,Soos,Brains! Braaains!
Scary-oke,Stan,"Holy Moses!(Grabs a chair, almost hits Zombie Soos)"
Scary-oke,Dipper,Wait! There's a page in here about curing zombification. It's gonna take a lot of formaldehyde.
Scary-oke,Mabel,"Ooh, and cinnamon!"
Scary-oke,Dipper,"Come on Soos, let's fix you up."
Scary-oke,Soos,Brains! Braaains!
Scary-oke,Mabel,"(Prodding Soos out of the room)Soos, cut it out!"
Scary-oke,Soos,"Heheh, sorry dude!"
Scary-oke,Dipper,I can't believe it! All this time the author's secrets were hiding in plain sight!(Pulls out aportable black lightand shines it on the journal)A whole new chapter of mysteries to explore...
Scary-oke,Narration,Cut to end credits.
Scary-oke,Narration,Agents Powers and Trigger climbs out of a ditch
Scary-oke,Trigger,That was insane! I've never seen anything like it! Who do we report to?
Scary-oke,Powers,(Pulls a zombie head off his jacket and watches it dissolve in his hand)This is bigger than we imagined. We need to bring in the big guns.
Scary-oke,Trigger,But they'll never believe us!
Scary-oke,Powers,Then we'llmakethem believe us. This is the town we've been searching for.
Scary-oke,Narration,"Toby walks by, swinging for a piñata and making weird noises."
Scary-oke,Trigger,Aah! Another zombie!
Scary-oke,Powers,Drop your weapon! Drop your weapon!
Scary-oke,Narration,Toby lifts his blindfold and looks at the agents.
Scary-oke,Agents,"Oh, it's just—Who is that guy?—just a very ugly man."
Scary-oke,Code,SMOFZQA JDF (WELCOME BACK decoded fromVigenere. The key is WIDDLE)
Into the Bunker,Narration,"Episode starts atWendy's house, whereDipperandWendyare watchingNearly Almost Dead But Not Quite!"
Into the Bunker,Trixandra,"What do we do, Chadley? I thought they were dead!"
Into the Bunker,Chadley,"Far worse, Trixandra! They're... Nearly Almost Dead But Not Quite!"
Into the Bunker,Trixandra,(Screams)
Into the Bunker,Dipper Pines,"Man, these movies are a lot less scary when you've actually foughtreal zombies."
Into the Bunker,Wendy Corduroy,(To the TV:)They're slow! Just power-walk away from them!
Into the Bunker,Dipper,(Pokes Wendy with his elbow)How much you want to bet that guy dies first?
Into the Bunker,TV,(Chomping noise)
Into the Bunker,Chadley,Aah! My face is being eaten a lot!
Into the Bunker,Wendy and Dipper,(Laugh)
Into the Bunker,Wendy,Chadley ain't pretty no more.
Into the Bunker,Narration,(Wendy's phone buzzes)
Into the Bunker,Wendy,"One second.(Grabs phone)Ugh, another text fromRobbie!"
Into the Bunker,Dipper,"Oh, yeah! Robbie. How's, uh, how's all that going?(Making circles with his finger)"
Into the Bunker,Wendy,"Ugh, I'm over him, I just wish he was over me! Just look at these texts.(Shows Dipper her phone)Winky frown? What does that even mean?"
Into the Bunker,Dipper,"And you're not...(Cough)not like, seeing any other guys or..."
Into the Bunker,Wendy,"Of course I am, meet my new boyfriend, dude.(Hugs plush walrus which sqeuaks)"
Into the Bunker,Dipper,"(Laughs)Right, right.(Nervous laugh)So, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to maybe if, you know, you and me, whatever. I mean if maybe you(Grimaces)wanted to join me and Mabel on this mystery hunt tomorrow? Conspiracy stuff and all that? That's all."
Into the Bunker,Wendy,"Yeah, dude. I love doing junk with friends.(To TV:)Yo Chadley, watch out!"
Into the Bunker,Dipper,"Yeah, 'cause that's what we are.(Looks at a note he had written about confessing his crush on Wendy)It's all we'll ever be.(Crumples it up, lies back on Wendy's bed)Friends."
Into the Bunker,Wendy,"(Casually)Dude, you're laying on my bra."
Into the Bunker,Dipper,(Screams)
Into the Bunker,Narration,Cut totheme song.
Into the Bunker,Narration,Workmen are fixing up the nearly destroyedMystery Shack.
Into the Bunker,Stan Pines,"Hey, easy with that, it's genuine plastic! And repave the cracks in the parking lot while you're at it!(Looking into chasm)I don't wantmy carfalling into China!"
Into the Bunker,Workman,"Mr. Pines, what exactly caused all this damage? I need to write a report."
Into the Bunker,Stan,"Uhhh, big woodpecker."
Into the Bunker,Narration,Gift shop sign falls over.
Into the Bunker,Stan,Keep the change.(Stuffs several bills into the workman's front pocket)...I'm winking under my eye patch.
Into the Bunker,Workman,Works for me.
Into the Bunker,Stan,"(Lifts his eye patch, looks around)Now where'd those kids run off to?"
Into the Bunker,Narration,"(Dipper,Mabel, andSoosare standing around the tree that containedJournal 3)"
Into the Bunker,Dipper,(Taps a pen on his lantern)Thank you all for coming.
Into the Bunker,Mabel Pines,"Hey, when there's a mystery, you can count on your sister...-Ey."
Into the Bunker,Soos Ramirez,"(Laughs)That's an amazing rhyme. When you want some, good... When you need a Soos, you... Oh oh, gosh, I don't know."
Into the Bunker,Dipper,"We're here to solve the number one mystery inGravity Falls; who wrote this journal?! Thirty years ago the author vanished without a trace. But according to this new clue,(Turns onportable black light)we may have found his secret hiding place.(The black light reveals hidden drawings on the page)We find that author, we learn the answers to everything. We just need to figure out a way to get down there."
Into the Bunker,Wendy,"Chop it down, dudes!(Arrives on bike, rings bell)"
Into the Bunker,Mabel,Wendy!
Into the Bunker,Dipper,"Oh, hey! You came."
Into the Bunker,Wendy,"Dude, I'm so stoked about this. I've been wanting to go adventuring with you guys. Sure beats picking up after my dad at home."
Into the Bunker,Narration,Cut toManly Danat home.
Into the Bunker,Manly Dan,(Repeatedly hits his head on the low ceiling and knocks down a beam)Ow! Ow! Ow! Who put that wall there? Ow!
Into the Bunker,Narration,Cut back to the gang.
Into the Bunker,Wendy,"Thanks for the invite, man!"
Into the Bunker,Dipper,"(Flustered:)Of course, anytime you wanna... I'm, we're always... Us."
Into the Bunker,Mabel,Uh oh!(Pokes Dipper)Inviting Wendy on our mission? Me thinks there's romance afoot!
Into the Bunker,Dipper,"No, look Mabel. I've thought this through and I'm over Wendy. I've looked at it from every angle, and that thing was going nowhere. I know what matters to me now, and it's finding the author of this journal."
Into the Bunker,Mabel,"Hah! YOU'RE over Wendy?! Allow me to put on my ""skepticals.""(Makes circles around her eyes with her fingers)Whooop!"
Into the Bunker,Dipper,"I've moved on, Mabel. You should too."
Into the Bunker,Mabel,Skepticals...
Into the Bunker,Wendy,"Hey, is it just me, or does that branch kinda look like a lever?"
Into the Bunker,Narration,Dipper turns his back on the tree. Wendy uses her belt to start climbing up the tree.
Into the Bunker,Dipper,"Huh, yeah. But how do we get up there...? It seems we'd need like a ladder, or like, ladder shoes... Yeah, ladder shoes. I'll get Soos to draw up a prototype."
Into the Bunker,Wendy,"(At the lever-branch now, pulls an ax out of her belt, swings it around and hits the lever)Boosh."
Into the Bunker,Soos,Whoa ho-ho!
Into the Bunker,Mabel,(Gasps)Wow!
Into the Bunker,Wendy,"Oh yeah, my dad used to make me compete in these lumberjack games when I was a kid. Guess I kinda ruled at it."
Into the Bunker,Narration,The tree begins shaking. Three crows fly away.
Into the Bunker,Wendy,"Whoa, whoa, what is that?(Falls down, screaming)"
Into the Bunker,Narration,"At the bottom, the ground and tree sink down, taking Wendy with it. The others pull her out before she falls in. They stand around it as a staircase to the middle of the tree appears, and subsequently a door inside the tree opens."
Into the Bunker,Dipper,"Alright guys, this is it. Remember, whatever happens down there, we tell no one."
Into the Bunker,Mabel,(Gives thumbs up)
Into the Bunker,Soos,(Turns hat backwards)
Into the Bunker,Wendy,(Zips her lips)
Into the Bunker,Dipper,"(Holds up a lantern)Now, who wants to go first?"
Into the Bunker,All,(Walk down the staircase and into aroom)
Into the Bunker,Mabel and Soos,Whoa!
Into the Bunker,Dipper,Cool!
Into the Bunker,Wendy,"This is so, stupid cool!"
Into the Bunker,Dipper,It's like a fallout shelter or something. It must've belonged to the author.
Into the Bunker,Wendy,(Takes the Fallout Shelter poster off the wall and dusts it off)This is going over my bed.
Into the Bunker,Mabel,(Puts face in a barrel and comes out with Wooly Bear caterpillars on her face)Haha! My face feels fuzzy!
Into the Bunker,Dipper,"This is incredible! It's like he was preparing for a disaster. But what kinda disaster would need supplies for over sixty years?(Looks up a shelf with dated boxes, the highest labeled 2070)"
Into the Bunker,Soos,"(Opens weapons locker)Oh my gosh! ASmezdespenser! I remember these things. What's that, yes I will have some of your old-timey face food.(Eats candy from dispenser)Ew, dusty!(Eats a second piece)"
Into the Bunker,Dipper,"(Holding drippingbean can)Wait guys, I think this can was opened recently."
Into the Bunker,Soos,"The author might still be alive, down here!"
Into the Bunker,Wendy,"Wait a minute...(Wendy pulls it down a map of Gravity Falls from 1982, revealing an open hatch cover)I think I know where he might have gone...(Leads everyone in crawling through the tunnel)Whoa!(Leads into a room made of metal cubes)Whoa! Oh, man! Was this place built in the past or the future?"
Into the Bunker,Soos,This room is way creepy.
Into the Bunker,Mabel,"Not as creepy as Dipper's internet history! Heyo!(Shoves Dipper, and he steps on the square with the design and it depresses, causing the hatch to slam and lock. The symbols on the other wall squares glow red, a buzzer sounds and the room starts to shake. Some squares start to poke into the room)"
Into the Bunker,Soos,"What's goin' on, dude?"
Into the Bunker,All,"(Pressing up against wall, beginning to panic)"
Into the Bunker,Mabel,"Haha, it's hard to be scared with caterpillars on your face. Wall things! Crazy wall things happening right now!"
Into the Bunker,Wendy,(Tries to push the blocks back in)It won't stop!
Into the Bunker,Mabel,Dipper! What do we do?!
Into the Bunker,Dipper,"(Flips frantically through the journal and stops at a page labeled ""Security Room."" He shines the blacklight on it)Oh, come on!(Shows them a page with symbol on it)Find these four symbols! Quick! Everybody step on one!"
Into the Bunker,Soos,One!(Pushes symbol)
Into the Bunker,Wendy,Two!(Punches symbol)
Into the Bunker,Mabel,Three!(Jumps over and slaps the symbol)
Into the Bunker,Dipper,Four!(Climbs up blocks and taps symbol; a door opens on the other side of the room)
Into the Bunker,Mabel,Run for it!
Into the Bunker,All,"(Run out; Dipper's vest get caught in the block, he slips out)"
Into the Bunker,Wendy,"Yes! Yes! That was, huh, that was nuts!(To Dipper:)You ruled back there, man!"
Into the Bunker,Dipper,"Haha, thanks."
Into the Bunker,Wendy,Get a load of this crazy surveillance room.
Into the Bunker,Soos,Check it out dudes!(Makes faces with beakers in front)
Into the Bunker,Wendy,"Soos, Soos... That is hilarious."
Into the Bunker,Mabel,"(To Dipper:)Hey bro, you forgot your vest.(Walks over to Dipper's vest and pulls it out, causing the note fall to the floor)What the...?(Reading aloud:)""Dear Wendy, I've always had a crush on...""(Gasps and covers her mouth with the note. Excitedly, to herself:)OHMYGOSH!(To Dipper:)Hey, Dipper! Look what I found..."
Into the Bunker,Dipper,(Gasps)What are you...? Give me that!(Snatches it)
Into the Bunker,Mabel,I knew it! I knew it! I knew it! You're not over Wendy at all!(Gasps)And you were gonna tell her today?
Into the Bunker,Dipper,"No, I changed my mind; it's a bad idea. I'd just embarrass myself and then I'd be another guy she hates, like Robbie."
Into the Bunker,Mabel,"Dipper, you should just tell her already. One way or another, you'll feel better afterwards."
Into the Bunker,Dipper,"Look, Mabel, I can't tell her no matter how much I want to, so just drop it OK?"
Into the Bunker,Wendy,"Dude! Dipper, you gotta check out this weird metal closet.(Robot voice:)I am a robot, I have a metal closet."
Into the Bunker,Dipper,(To Wendy:)Coming!(To Mabel:)This never happened.
Into the Bunker,Mabel,"(Thinking:)He wants to tell her but he's scared; maybe he needs a little push. Good idea, Mabel. Thanks, Mabel!(Runs and hugs Dipper. Speaking:)Brother, whatever happens, I just want you to know something: this is for your own good."
Into the Bunker,Dipper,What?
Into the Bunker,Mabel,(Shoves him into the closet with Wendy and shuts it)
Into the Bunker,Dipper,"What the-?(Looks at Wendy, gasps and pounds on the door)MABEL! Let us out!"
Into the Bunker,Mabel,"Oh, I'll let you out Dipper, as soon as you tell Wendy that thing you've been wanting to tell her! You'll thank me for this later!"
Into the Bunker,Wendy,What is she talking about?
Into the Bunker,Dipper,Nothing! Mabel's just been eating raw sugar packets again.
Into the Bunker,Mabel,(Eating raw sugar packets)Om nom... That's besides the point!
Into the Bunker,Dipper,Let me out RIGHT NOW!(Pounds on the door)
Into the Bunker,Wendy,Uh! Where are the lights?(Pulls cord)
Into the Bunker,Dipper and Wendy,AHHH!
Into the Bunker,Narration,"Water gushes down, followed by a blast of hot air that pushes them together. A red light flashes and a tone sounds. A sign reading ""Decontamination Complete"" flashes and doors open on a wrecked underground room."
Into the Bunker,Dipper,Whoa! A hidden lab! Maybe the author did experiments down here.
Into the Bunker,Wendy,Huh. What do you think dug all these tunnels?
Into the Bunker,Dipper,"Let's hope we don't find out.(Hears a growling sound, screams and runs as a dark figure approaches)Mabel, open up, for real! There's a monster in here!"
Into the Bunker,Mabel,"Ha ha, nice try! The only monsters are your own inner demons, Dipper!"
Into the Bunker,Soos,That is so wise.
Into the Bunker,Wendy,"Dipper, just say whatever Mabel wants you to say, so she'll let us out of here!"
Into the Bunker,Mabel,"Come on Dipper! Now's the time, bro!"
Into the Bunker,Dipper,"Wendy, I— I... I'm gonna find another way out!(Grabs Wendy's hand and pulls her in the other direction)"
Into the Bunker,Wendy,"Wait, what? Dude, where are we going?(They run down a tunnel and the thing corners them there)What do we do?"
Into the Bunker,Dipper,I don't know!(They watch as the shadows of a man and the creature fight)
Into the Bunker,Unknown Man,"Back, back you heinous beast!(Walks forward into view)Well, I just ripped out a monster's tongue.(Throws it down on the ground in front of them)"
Into the Bunker,Dipper,"It's, it's you!"
Into the Bunker,Unknown Man,"Hurry now, I scared it off, but it'll regenerate.(Leads them down the tunnel)I wasn't expecting guests. I've been down here for a very long time. Years! Weeks, maybe! I miss orange juice."
Into the Bunker,Dipper,"You don't understand, you're the guy I've been looking for!"
Into the Bunker,Wendy,He's the guy?
Into the Bunker,Dipper,"Wendy, it's the guy!"
Into the Bunker,Unknown Man,The guy?
Into the Bunker,Dipper,"I've got, like, a jillion questions! Why did you write the journals? Who was after you? Why did you build this bunker?"
Into the Bunker,Unknown Man,"Heh. My boy I'd love to discuss this in time. But we have more pressing matters.(All begin to walk around the lab)It's one of my experiments, ashape shifter. Able to take the form of anyone or anything it sees. It broke free from a cage of solid steel! I've gone half crazy trying to catch the creature alone. But now you're here! Will you help me catch it?(Lifts goggles)"
Into the Bunker,Dipper,(Gasps in excitement)
Into the Bunker,Narration,Cut to Mabel and Soos exploring the other room.
Into the Bunker,Soos,"Sure are taking their time in there.(Slips on lab coat, and picks up some kind of briefcase)Hey, do I look smarter with this coat and briefcase? I feel like I look smarter..."
Into the Bunker,Mabel,(Gasps)Razzle dazzle! Look at this tube-y thing!(Pressing button on dashboard)Frozen! Unfrozen! Frozen! Unfrozen! What's this? Experiment number 210: the shape shifter.
Into the Bunker,Soos,"Shape shifter? Uh, dude? Didn't Dipper say there was a monster in there with them?"
Into the Bunker,Mabel,(Gasps)I thought he was just joking!
Into the Bunker,Soos,YOU KNOW DIPPER'S JOKES ARE TERRIBLE!
Into the Bunker,Mabel,DIPPER!!
Into the Bunker,Narration,"Cut back to Dipper, Wendy, and the Unknown Man, still in the lab."
Into the Bunker,Unknown Man,"Come in, come in! I apologize for the state of things! I don't get many non-mole-people visitors. Now the beast must have some weakness that we can exploit. I used to have my research on him. But alas, I lost my journals so many years ago."
Into the Bunker,Wendy,Did you say journals?
Into the Bunker,Dipper,Dude! I found one of them! It's how I tracked you down here.(Pulls out journal)
Into the Bunker,Unknown Man,"What?! Could it be? Hehe.(Takes journal from Dipper)My boy! I can't express my gratitude!(Flips through pages of the journal)Oh yes, after all these years..."
Into the Bunker,Narration,"Cut to Mabel and Soos running in to the other room, both are panting."
Into the Bunker,Soos,"Wendy?! Oh, it's so dark! How will we ever find them?"
Into the Bunker,Mabel,Leave that to Mabel!(Presses light bulb on sweater)
Into the Bunker,Soos,"Whoa, rad! Although, isn't electric clothing kinda like a fire hazard?"
Into the Bunker,Mabel,No. It's a fun hazard. Now let me light the way!(Runs off with Soos following behind)
Into the Bunker,Soos,We're coming for you dudes!
Into the Bunker,Narration,"Cut back to Wendy, Dipper, and the Unknown Man, who is skimming through the pages of the journal."
Into the Bunker,Unknown Man,"(To himself)Yes, yes. It's all here."
Into the Bunker,Dipper,"(Whispering to Wendy, as she picks up a can of beans)Wendy! Isn't it amazing we're actually meeting the real author?"
Into the Bunker,Wendy,"(Gasps and bites lip terrified. Holding out the can to Dipper. Whispering:)Dipper! Look!(Shows him a can ofBaron Num Nums High Flyin' Beanswith a picture of ""the author"" on it)"
Into the Bunker,Dipper,"(To ""Baron Num Nums"" nervously:)Uhh, you know what? We should probably get going. Can I have my journal back?"
Into the Bunker,"""Baron Num Nums""","(Blinks eyes sideways and turns head all the way around, realizing he's been found out. voice deepening:)You're not going anywhere.(Crawls up wall and grows spider legs)"
Into the Bunker,Dipper and Wendy,AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!
Into the Bunker,Shape Shifter,"(turns into ""true form"")How do you like my true form? Go on, admit it, you like it!"
Into the Bunker,Dipper,You! What did you do to the real author?!
Into the Bunker,Shape Shifter,"You'll likely never find him. Thatsix-fingered nerdhasn't been himself in thirty years! But I do thank you for bringing me his journal. He used to write it while I was in my cage. So many wonderful forms to take!(Flipping through the journal, it transforms into theGremloblin, agnome, and then theHide Behind, laughing each time)"
Into the Bunker,Dipper,(Whispering to Wendy:)We've gotta get that journal back!
Into the Bunker,Wendy,Hey body snatcher!(Picks up can of beans and throws at shape shifter)Snatch this!
Into the Bunker,Shape Shifter,"(Dodges it, turns into a giant frog monster, and lashes its tongue out at Wendy)"
Into the Bunker,Wendy,"(Holds up a piece of metal to block the tongue, making it drop the journal)"
Into the Bunker,Dipper,RUN! RUN! RUN!
Into the Bunker,Dipper and Wendy,(Run through tunnels)
Into the Bunker,Shape Shifter,"(Chasing them while taking several forms, then turns into a giant pill bug monster and chases them to a fork in the tunnels)"
Into the Bunker,Dipper,(Throws his flashlight down one end and runs with Wendy down the other end. They crash into Soos and Mabel)
Into the Bunker,All,(Greet each other excitedly)
Into the Bunker,Dipper,(To Soos and Mabel:)Wait! Careful. How do we know they're not the shape shifter?
Into the Bunker,Soos,"Maybe I am! Mabel, inspect my shape!(Pulls up shirt)"
Into the Bunker,Mabel,(Pokes Soos' stomach)Poke!
Into the Bunker,Soos,(Laughs)Do that again!
Into the Bunker,Mabel,(Pokes Soos' stomach again)Poke!
Into the Bunker,Soos,(Laughs once more)Even better the second time!
Into the Bunker,Dipper,"It's definitely them.(Gasps)Oh my gosh, Wendy, you're bleeding!"
Into the Bunker,Wendy,"It's cool, it's cool. It's just blood, man; don't freak out."
Into the Bunker,Mabel,What happened?
Into the Bunker,Wendy,"We got attacked by the shape shifter.(Taking off her shirt, and rips off a sleeve to cover the injury)He broke out of his cage, pretended to be the author, and wants Dipper's journal."
Into the Bunker,Dipper,Imagine if he escapes into town! He could transform into anything! We could never trust anyone ever again!
Into the Bunker,Mabel,What do we do?!
Into the Bunker,Wendy,"Well, he took us into his home, tricked us, and tried to destroy us. I say we return the favor."
Into the Bunker,Narration,"Cut to a different tunnel. The shape shifter returns to its ""Baron Num Nums"" form."
Into the Bunker,Shape Shifter,"Dipper, my boy! Come out!(Momentarily loses its form)I must speak with you!(Turns into a creature with six legs, claws, and a one-eyed head resembling a hand)REVEAL YOURSELF, YOU SINGLE-FORMED HUMAN WEAKLING!(Slams its head into the ground)"
Into the Bunker,Mabel,"(Entering the room with Dipper)Oh boy, Dipper. That book sure is full of some great monsters!"
Into the Bunker,Shape Shifter,"There you are! Ooh, and a new one.(Turns into Mabel)Should I be one...(Turns into Dipper)...or the other? How about both!?(Turns into a six-legged creature. The top half resembles Dipper while the bottom half resembles Mabel. Both halves have a large mouth with many sharp teeth. Roars)"
Into the Bunker,Dipper and Mabel,(They scream and run away as the shape shifter chases them. They enter a room with Wendy and Soos holding onto the valve of a pipe)
Into the Bunker,Dipper,"Guys, he's coming! He's coming! NOW, NOW, NOW, NOW!!"
Into the Bunker,Wendy and Soos,(Start turning the valve)
Into the Bunker,Soos,"It's not working, dude!"
Into the Bunker,Shape Shifter,(Catches up to them and tries to grab Dipper's journal with its tongue)
Into the Bunker,Dipper,"HEY, LET GO!"
Into the Bunker,Wendy,(Helps Dipper)You leave him alone!
Into the Bunker,Narration,Wendy is pulled away with the journal. Dipper is left behind.
Into the Bunker,Dipper,Wendy!
Into the Bunker,Narration,"Wendy jumps on the shape shifter and prepares to attack it with her ax. Soos successfully turns the valve and a strong stream of water bursts from the pipe. Wendy and the shape shifter are knocked back by the water. Dipper, Mabel and Soos get caught in the flow as well. Wendy hits a rock under the water, then the water subsides."
Into the Bunker,"Dipper, Mabel & Soos",(Gasp for air)
Into the Bunker,Narration,The water drains out.
Into the Bunker,Dipper,"(Picks up Wendy's ax)WENDY!!(Voice echoes, follows the tunnel and finds ""Wendy"" laying on the ground)Wendy! No, no, no-no-no! Can you hear me? Oh, please be okay, please be okay!(Shakes ""her"", with no response)Oh no, oh no! This is all my fault! If I had told you when we were in the closet, we wouldn't be in this mess. But I was too scared and now you could be hurt or worse, and I never even got a chance to tell you I'm, like—in love with you, Wendy!(Tears up and buries face in hands)"
Into the Bunker,Wendy,"(Standing behind Dipper)...Uh, Dipper?"
Into the Bunker,Dipper,"Huh—wha—Wendy?! W-wait, then who's...?"
Into the Bunker,Shape Shifter,(Gets up and growls)
Into the Bunker,Dipper,LOOK OUT!
Into the Bunker,Shape Shifter,"(Attacks Wendy, in Wendy's voice)Give me back that journal!"
Into the Bunker,Wendy,Never!
Into the Bunker,Shape Shifter,(Pushes her over and lands on her)
Into the Bunker,Wendy,Get off me!(Kicks the shape shifter off)
Into the Bunker,Narration,The two Wendys fight while Dipper watches. It is unclear which is the shape shifter. Dipper picks up the ax and approaches them.
Into the Bunker,Wendy,Give it back; it belongs to Dipper!(To Dipper:)Hit her with the ax!
Into the Bunker,Shape Shifter,"Don't listen to her, Dipper!"
Into the Bunker,Wendy,She's the shape shifter!
Into the Bunker,Dipper,"Uh, uh, I don't know who's who! Give me a sign!"
Into the Bunker,Shape Shifter,(Smiles and winks)
Into the Bunker,Wendy,(Zips her lips)
Into the Bunker,Dipper,(Stabs the shape shifter with the ax)
Into the Bunker,Shape Shifter,(Roars and returns to its true form)
Into the Bunker,Narration,"The tube that Mabel froze and unfroze earlier flashes ""READY."" The shape shifter rips the ax out of its body."
Into the Bunker,Dipper,Push him in!
Into the Bunker,Narration,Dipper and Wendy push the shape shifter into the tube. The door closes and the tube begins freezing the shape shifter. The shot pulls back to show Mabel and Soos watching through a screen. Mabel has pressed the button to activate the tube.
Into the Bunker,Mabel,Frozen!(She and Soos fist-bump)Boop!
Into the Bunker,Soos,Boosh!
Into the Bunker,Shape Shifter,"No!(Turns into a rock monster, then a flame monster, then back to ""Baron Num Nums"" trying to break out)No! Let me ouuuut!(Returns to its true form and roars. It begins to freeze)"
Into the Bunker,Narration,"Mabel and Soos are now in the same room as Wendy, Dipper, and the shape shifter."
Into the Bunker,Soos,"Let's get out of here, dudes."
Into the Bunker,Shape Shifter,(Laughs evilly)
Into the Bunker,"Dipper, Mabel, Wendy and Soos",(Gasp)
Into the Bunker,Shape Shifter,"You think you're so clever, don't you, Dipper? But you have no idea what you're up against. You will never find the author. If you keep digging, you'll meet a fate worse than you can imagine. And this will be the last form you ever take!(Turns into Dipper andscreams while being frozen, while Dipper looks on in horror)"
Into the Bunker,Soos,(Laughs. To Dipper:)Good luck sleeping tonight!
Into the Bunker,Narration,Cut to outside. The tree returns to its default position
Into the Bunker,Soos,"Dude, I think I'm kind of adventured out for a little while. My face hurts from doing this all day.(Makes a screaming face)"
Into the Bunker,Mabel,"(Laughs)Yeah, but you gotta admit we're all total heroes."
Into the Bunker,Soos,"(Tousles Mabel's hair)Hey, who wants to get some heroes' breakfast, huh?"
Into the Bunker,Mabel,(On Soos' shoulders)Syrup on cereal!
Into the Bunker,Soos,"Mabel, you're a visionary!"
Into the Bunker,Dipper,"Look, Wendy, about earlier. In the heat of the moment, I might have said some dumb things, and can't we just pretend none of that ever happened? Please?"
Into the Bunker,Wendy,"Dude, dude. It's okay. I always kinda knew."
Into the Bunker,Dipper,"Wait, you did?"
Into the Bunker,Wendy,"(Chuckles)Yeah man, you think I can't hear that stuff you're constantly whispering under your breath?"
Into the Bunker,Dipper,(Groans)Oh man!(Sits down on a log)
Into the Bunker,Wendy,"Listen Dipper, I'm like, super flattered, but... I'm too old for you. I mean, you know that, right?"
Into the Bunker,Dipper,(Groans)Mabel said confessing would make me feel better.
Into the Bunker,Wendy,"Well, how do you feel?"
Into the Bunker,Dipper,Anxious. Scared. Kinda itchy.
Into the Bunker,Wendy,"Dude, don't be itchy man. Let me tell you something. This summer was super boring until you showed up. I have more fun with you than, like, practically anybody else. And if you ever stopped being my friend... I would, like, throw myself into theBottomless Pit!"
Into the Bunker,Dipper,"So things won't be too, awkward, now?"
Into the Bunker,Wendy,"I just wrestled myself, dude. That was awkward. If you can handle that monster, you can handle a little awkwardness."
Into the Bunker,Dipper,Friends?
Into the Bunker,Wendy,"Yeah, dude! Friends!(Shoves him backwards off the log)"
Into the Bunker,Narration,"Both laugh, then Wendy pulls him back onto the log."
Into the Bunker,Wendy,"Oh, and hey Dipper? See you for movie night tomorrow. Your place this time, okay?(Bikes away)"
Into the Bunker,Mabel,(Pops out of bushes)Sooo? How did it go?
Into the Bunker,Dipper,(Surprised:)Wha—what did you hear?
Into the Bunker,Mabel,Everything! All the time!
Into the Bunker,Soos,(From in the bushes:)I'M NOT HERE!
Into the Bunker,Dipper,"Mabel, how can everything be so amazing and so terrible all at the same time?"
Into the Bunker,Mabel,"I'm sorry for being so pushy, Dipper. If it's any consolation, I'm already working on your list of potential rebound crushes."
Into the Bunker,Dipper,"Thanks, Mabel. Whoa!"
Into the Bunker,Soos,"(Sits down at other end of log)I'm still bummed we're no closer to finding the author guy. At least I got his science-y coat and briefcase.(Holds up ""briefcase"", which flops open revealing that it's actually alaptop)Whoa! What the?"
Into the Bunker,Dipper,"Soos, that's not a briefcase, that's a laptop!"
Into the Bunker,Mabel,And a really busted up one too.
Into the Bunker,Soos,I bet I could get this thing fixed up in a few days. It's gonna take a lotta duct tape.
Into the Bunker,Dipper,This could be our next clue!
Into the Bunker,Narration,"Zooms in on the laptop. A label reads ""Property of F"" MO52584"
Into the Bunker,Narration,Cut to end credits. Dipper and Wendy are watching a movie on TV.

The Golf War,Narration,"The newspaper reads ""GREATEST THING OF THE SUMMER!"", and shows a portrait of Pacifica Northwest, with the caption ""PACIFICA NORTHWEST."""
The Golf War,Dipper,(Looking at the newspaper)Looks like someone bought their way to the front page.
The Golf War,Stan,(Looking at the newspaper)Is it legal for a child to wear that much make-up?
The Golf War,Mabel,"Ugh, Pacifica! She always ruins everything!"
The Golf War,Dipper,"Aw, cheer up Mabel! I mean, no one even reads newspapers anymore."
The Golf War,Soos Ramirez,"(Walks in)Dudes! V-neck season is upon us! Who wants to help me get ahead of the fashion curve?

What do you say, Mabel? We've had a stressful couple of days. How 'bout we take a break, huh?"

The Golf War,Soos,"Aw, don't give up, Mabel."
The Golf War,Dipper,"Yeah! If you beat her at this, she could never rag on you again. Imagine it!"
The Golf War,Mabel,(Imagines herself and Pacifica in a clothing store)
The Golf War,Pacifica,"Um, the section for ugly grandma clothes is over there."

The Golf War,Mabel,"(Stands on table)You're right, guys. I just need to practice a little more before midnight."
The Golf War,Stan,"Go to the golf course after dark, you say? I dunno, we'd... have to break in and- just kidding, let's break in!!"
The Golf War,Narration,Cut to Stan's car driving through the golf course's toll. Soos keeps watch while Stan pulls nails out of the fence. He removes a panel. Mabel hands him her sticker book and she and Dipper go through the hole.
The Golf War,Stan,"Oh, and hey, Mabel?(Sticks a ""U DA BEST"" sticker on Mabel's sweater)Knock her dead, kid."
The Golf War,Mabel,"(Gives a thumbs-up and goes inside. At the windmill, she is practicing, hitting a golf ball, which goes into the window, and comes to rest beside dozens of others, not in the hole.)Darn! Poop heck darn!"
The Golf War,Dipper,"Ugh, I don't get it! What is wrong with this hole?(Hears clanking inside the mill, backs away and gasps)Did you hear that?"
The Golf War,Mabel,What? What is it?
The Golf War,Dipper,(Whispering:)Grab your club.
The Golf War,Narration,"The twins raise their clubs and advance towards the windmill. They nod, and Dipper pulls away the back panel. TheLilliputtiansare merrily moving golf balls along their Dutch-themed landscape when they notice the twins and gasp."
The Golf War,Lilliputtians,(Scream)
The Golf War,Dipper and Mabel,(Scream)
The Golf War,Lilliputtians,(Scream)

The Golf War,Franz,"We good? We good? All right then! Hi, hello. I'm Franz, and welcome to our home!"
The Golf War,Dipper,What is this?
The Golf War,Mabel,"Yeah! Are you guys tiny humans, or enormous mini-humans?"
The Golf War,Franz,(laughs)Neither. We're Lilliputtians! Lilli- Lilliputt... the name makes more sense written out than spoken. And we control the balls! Behold!
The Golf War,Narration,"The side of the windmill opens, revealing a complex Rube Goldberg-ian convey system, with Lilliputtians turning cranks, pulling levers, and pushing turnstiles. A golf ball rolls out of the windmill into the hole."
The Golf War,Mabel,That's incredible!
The Golf War,Dipper,And so needlessly complicated!
The Golf War,Franz,Aw shucks. It's only our life-long passion. Would you like us to elaborate through song?
The Golf War,Narration,The Lilliputtians gather and prepare to sing.
The Golf War,Dipper,"Eh, we're good."
The Golf War,Narration,The Lilliputtians groan in disappointment and disperse.
The Golf War,Franz,So what are you hugelings doing here anyway?
The Golf War,Mabel,"We kind of have to play this golf tournament against my rival, Pacifica."
The Golf War,Narration,The Lilliputtians gasp and mutter.
The Golf War,Franz,"Oh, we know all about rivals."
The Golf War,Lilliputtian pirate captain,"Put a clog in it, ya windmill-lubbers!(The pirate ship lights up. The Pirate Lilliputtians are looking over the deck.)These frilly bottom popinjays are terrible at controllin' the balls!(Draws sword) Weare the ball masters, says I! Argh!"
The Golf War,Pirate Lilliputtians,Argh! Argh! Argh! Argh!
The Golf War,Lead French Lilliputtian,"Shut your mouths, you show-boating pirates!(The Eiffel Tower lights up)Everyone knows ze Eiffel Tower hole is ze best!"
The Golf War,French Lilliputtian,Je ne sais quoi. Sacrebleu. Au revoir !(Subtitled:)I don't actually know French.
The Golf War,Lilliputtian head knight,"Stay thee your comments, ye scurrilous Frenchmen!(Removes his helmet and shakes his hair)None control the balls better than the knights of—(Notices graffiti)Wiener Castle? Who wrote this?"
The Golf War,Franz,"We'll settle which hole is best! Attack!(Armed with golf pencils, the Dutchmen charge.)"
The Golf War,Lilliputtian pirate captain,"(Sarcastically:)Ooh, I'm shiverin' in me timbers! Get them!(The Pirates swing off of the ship and run towards the others.)"
The Golf War,Lilliputtian head knight,Long live the mini king!
The Golf War,Narration,The Lilliputtians collide and start fighting in front of the twins.
The Golf War,Dutch Lilliputtian,"(To a knight lilliputtian:)Die, medieval scum!(Jumps at the knight and they collide and fall backwards)Ow!"
The Golf War,Narration,The Head Pirate swings at a Frenchman and falls into the lake. A duck picks up a Dutchman and swallows him.
The Golf War,Dipper,(Laughs)These guys are a riot!
The Golf War,Mabel,"(Laughing)Guys, guys, calm down! Your fighting is inadvertently adorable!"
The Golf War,Franz,"(Bruised and battered)Adorable we are, hugeling, but our tale less so. Every hole in the park thinks they're superior, from the cowboys in the east to the grimy miners of the south. If only there was some way to decide which side is best, with... maybe... an award, or, like a trophy, I dunno."
The Golf War,French Lilliputtian,"But Franz, look!(Points to Mabel's sticker)"
The Golf War,Franz,The sticker. The sticker could decide!
The Golf War,French Lilliputtian,"It does say ""Ze best"" on it!"
The Golf War,Lilliputtian head knight,"Decide for us, hugeling! Choose which mini-kingdom to give the sticker to, and end our war!"
The Golf War,Narration,The Lilliputtians cheer.
The Golf War,Mabel,"Uh, I don't know, guys. I'm not sure I wanna get involved in your weird mini-blood feud."
The Golf War,Dipper,Pst! Mabel! This is perfect! These guys control the course! Just tell them you'll give the sticker to whichever group does a better job of helping us win!
The Golf War,Mabel,"I'm not sure, Dipper. I wanna beat Pacifica, but doesn't this seem like... cheating?"
The Golf War,Dipper,"Pacifica's rich, Mabel. She's cheating at life."
The Golf War,Mabel,Hmm...
The Golf War,Dipper,"(Blows on a tiny trumpet)Thanks, man.(Returns it to a knight)"
The Golf War,Mabel,"(Standing on the castle)People of the eighteen holes! We're going to have a game of mini-golf! And whoever does the best job helping me win, gets the sticker!"
The Golf War,Lilliputtian pirate captain,"It'll be us, lass. Not these tulip-munchers!"
The Golf War,Franz,I will not be insulted by a man with no depth perception wearing earrings!
The Golf War,Mabel,"Just remember, as long as you're helping me, no fighting."
The Golf War,Narration,The Lilliputtians look at each other and smile. Cut to the parking lot. Soos and Stan are in the car.
The Golf War,Soos,"Dude, I'm cuttin' Ws into all my shirts. Gotta give the public what they want."
The Golf War,Stan,"Well, those kids are taking their time. Looks like it's gonna be a while.(Turns on the radio. Soos takes off his shirt to work on the neck. Stan leans back in his seat and sighs. He closes his eyes, then looks over at Soos, who, still shirtless, has reclined next to him.)"
The Golf War,Soos,Sure are a lot of stars out tonight...
The Golf War,Stan,"(Sits up.)Well, this is gettin' weird.(Leaves.)"
The Golf War,Preston Northwest,"(TheNorthwest carpulls up.)Now remember, Pacifica, winning is everything."
The Golf War,Priscilla Northwest,"Oh, oh, and also looks. Winning and looks.(Looks at self in mirror.)"
The Golf War,Pacifica,"Dad, I've been practicing for, like, a million hours, okay? I've got this. You'll stay to watch, right?"
The Golf War,Preston Northwest,"Pacifica, darling, we have a party to go to. We'll just read about your victory in the paper."
The Golf War,Pacifica,(Gets out of car.)Sergei!(Sergei climbs out of the trunk and gets the luggage.)
The Golf War,Preston Northwest,"Oh, and whatever happens, just remember one thing. You're a Northwest. Don't lose.(Slams the door and the car drives away.)"
The Golf War,Pacifica,(Entering the park:)How much you wanna bet they're no-shows?
The Golf War,Narration,"A succession of lights flashes on, revealing Mabel and Dipper."
The Golf War,Mabel,Looking for someone?
The Golf War,Pacifica,"Waiting in the dark, not creepy at all. Seriously though, I don't know why you bothered to come. Unless you've got something up your sleeve."
The Golf War,Mabel,"Oh, I guess you could say we've got alittlesomething, right, right?(A Lilliputtian pops out of her sleeve. She shoves it back in, and she and Dipper laugh nervously.)"
The Golf War,Sergei,"Eighteen holes. Standard rules. Winner lives in glory, loser wallows in eternal shame. On your mark, get set, mini-golf!"
The Golf War,Narration,"At the cowboy hole. Pacifica putts; the Lilliputtians block her ball with a covered wagon. Mabel putts, and the cowboys raise the grass to move her ball towards the hole. A cowboy shoots the ball, and it goes in. Mabel gives a thumbs-up, and the cowboys return the gesture before turning to mock the pirates. At the pirate hole. Mabel putts, and the pirates shoot her ball out of a cannon into the hole."
The Golf War,Pacifica,Out of my way!(Putts. Her ball shoots out the front and lands in her mouth.)Are you serious?!
The Golf War,Narration,"The pirates cheer, open a can of root beer, and raise their flag. At the miner hole. Mabel putts, and the ball goes down into the mine."
The Golf War,Dipper,"Ha, ha! Miner hole. I wonder what cute, silly things are going on down there."
The Golf War,Narration,The ball rolls down a chute and two miners prepare to cart it into the mine.
The Golf War,Prospector Lilliputtian,Stop! You can't go in there! There's been a gas leak! Anyone who goes in there will DIE!!
The Golf War,Narration,"The miners look scared, then part asBig Henryapproaches."
The Golf War,Big Henry,I'll take it.
The Golf War,Polly,"Noooo!(Runs up to Big Henry.)Don't go, Big Henry! We need you!"
The Golf War,Big Henry,"Go home, Polly."
The Golf War,Narration,"Big Henry pushes the cart into the mine, leaving the others staring after him. Sweating and breathing heavily, he trudges on through the seeping gas. Cut to the outside, where Mabel and Pacifica are waiting silently for the ball to reemerge. Pacifica checks her watch. Back in the mine. Big Henry slaps himself."
The Golf War,Big Henry,"Come on, Big Henry. You can do this.(Reaches the end of the track and, struggling, pushes the button to send up the ball. He collapses beside the track, gasping, and pulls out a picture of him and Polly. His eyes fill with tears, smiles, and with a groan of satisfaction he dies peacefully.)"
The Golf War,Narration,The ball rolls out of the mine and into the hole.
The Golf War,Pacifica,"Aah! No!(Throws her club, which Sergei catches.)Sergei! Soda! Now!"
The Golf War,Mabel,"(Lifts the lid of the mine hole.)Okay, guys? That was bedonkulous!"
The Golf War,Dipper,"Hey, hey, little hi-fives, everyone, little hi-fives all around.(High-fives the miners with his finger)Nice one... You did it... You're the man."
The Golf War,Mabel,"I don't wanna call it out early, but I think the miners might have one of these in their future!(points to sticker. The miners cheer.)"
The Golf War,Franz,(Looking at them through a telescope from the windmill)Are you kidding me?! After everything we've worked for?
The Golf War,Dutch Lilliputtian,"Calm yourself, Franz. There may be another way to win the hugeling's favor. Knock on wood.(They knock on their clogs.)"
The Golf War,Narration,Cut to Pacifica and Sergei. Sergei gets a Pitt cola from the vending machine.
The Golf War,Pacifica,"There's something going on, Sergei. I can feel it."
The Golf War,Sergei,Maybe they has little people who control where the balls go.
The Golf War,Pacifica,"Hoo, we gotta get you English lessons. I mean, think about it. I'm globally ranked. It's ridiculous that she's beating me.(A tiny figure darts behind a bush. Pacifica drinks the soda and spits out the pit)Ugh,Pitt Cola! I always forget about the pit. Get me a different one, Sergei.(A tiny hand taps her shoulder. She is grabbed and dragged into the bush.)"
The Golf War,Sergei,This is bad.
The Golf War,Narration,"Cut to Dipper and Mabel, tallying the scores."
The Golf War,Dipper,"I can't wait to see the look on Pacifica's face when we win. I'm thinking it'll be like ""ugh.""(Makes face.)You know how she does that? ""Ugh."""
The Golf War,Mabel,"Dipper, is it bad that I feel good about her feeling bad?"
The Golf War,Dipper,"Ah, just enjoy your victory, Mabel. Trust me, Pacifica will be fine."
The Golf War,Pacifica,(Screams.)(She is tied in front of the windmill by the Dutch Lilliputtians.)What's going on here? Let me go!
The Golf War,Dipper and Mabel,(Screams. The Lilliputtian peeps out of Mabel's sleeve.)
The Golf War,Lilliputtian,(Screams.)What'd I miss?
The Golf War,Pacifica,"Let me go, you creeps!"
The Golf War,Franz,"Welcome twins, welcome! I can tell you're loving this, right, right? No?"
The Golf War,Mabel,What are you guys doing?
The Golf War,Dipper,"This wasn't part of the deal, tiny Dutchman!"
The Golf War,Franz,"Okay, so we saw you were favoring the miners, and we figured, what's better than beating Pacifica?(blows raspberry)Killing her, right?"
The Golf War,Pacifica,As if! I'm calling my parents. Where's my phone?
The Golf War,Narration,"The Lilliputtians have taken it and are sending the message ""U R DUMM!"" to someone named Tiffany."
The Golf War,Lilliputtian,"Hehe, send."
The Golf War,Pacifica,"Hey, hey!"
The Golf War,Franz,"So how about it, hugeling? Who's da best now?"
The Golf War,Lilliputtian pirate captain,"Not so fast land lubbers!(The pirates reveal that they have captured Sergei.)If you're going to play dirty, so are we. Now give us the sticker, or he walks the plank!"
The Golf War,French Lilliputtian,No! Give us ze sticker!
The Golf War,Miner Lilliputtians,The miners! Give it to the miners!
The Golf War,Narration,"The Lilliputtians all clamor, pressuring Mabel, until she screams-"
The Golf War,Mabel,ENOUGH!(The Lilliputtians look at her. One peeks out of the duck's beak.)
The Golf War,Mabel,You know what?Noone gets the sticker!
The Golf War,French Lilliputtian,Sacre booo!
The Golf War,Lilliputtians,(Boo.)
The Golf War,Mabel,"No, no. Nuh-uh. No booing- stop, no! No one gets the sticker cuz you're all being jerks! I mean, why can't you just get along?"
The Golf War,Narration,Beat.
The Golf War,Dutch Lilliputtian,Because we hate each other.
The Golf War,Lilliputtian pirate captain,"That's kind of how rivalries work, lass."
The Golf War,Mabel,"Well then, maybe... maybe rivalries are dumb. Maybe you don't settle them with petty competitions. Maybe the only way to be ""da best"" is by ending the fighting and working together!(Rips off the sticker and eats it angrily. The Lilliputtians gasp and converse.)"
The Golf War,Dutch Lilliputtian,It's all so clear.
The Golf War,Franz,If we work together...
The Golf War,Lilliputtian pirate captain,Then we can cut open her belly and get the sticker!(All cheer and rush forward.)
The Golf War,French Lilliputtian,Get ze girl! Slice her open!
The Golf War,Mabel,"Uh, you guys aren't appreciating the lesson here!"
The Golf War,Narration,"A lever is pulled near Pacifica, and she starts being pulled toward the whirring blades of the windmill. She screams."
The Golf War,Dipper,We've got to get out of here!
The Golf War,Mabel,"I have to save Pacifica first!(Climbs a lamp post, followed by the swarm of Lilliputtians. She swings along a chain of lights and lands by the windmill, evading the golf pencil spears thrown by the crowd.)"
The Golf War,Sergei,"(About to fall off the plank:)Ah, Mister Dipper! Нет, нет!(pronounced as ""Niet, niet!""; Russian for ""No, no!"")"
The Golf War,Dipper,"Don't freak out, man! The water's shallow! There's literally no way to drown!"
The Golf War,Sergei,(Falls in face first.)
The Golf War,Dipper,Seriously?
The Golf War,Pacifica,"(As Mabel unties her:)Ugh, took you long enough, And watch the earrings. They're worth more than your house."
The Golf War,Mabel,"You know, on second thought, maybe I won't untie you."
The Golf War,Pacifica,Untie me! Untie me!
The Golf War,Mabel,That's what I thought.(Pulls Pacifica free and grabs a golf club.)
The Golf War,Lilliputtian pirate captain,We have you at miniature pencil point! There's no way around us!
The Golf War,Mabel,You ready to putt?
The Golf War,Pacifica,"Way ahead of you.(Grabs her club and they start swinging at the Lilliputtians.)You know, you're actually not that terrible. A little rusty, but-"
The Golf War,Mabel,Just shut up and putt!
The Golf War,Narration,The Lilliputtians are hit out of the way. Dipper and Sergei show up driving a golf cart.
The Golf War,Dipper,"Get on, get on!"
The Golf War,Mabel,Gun it!(They drive away.)
The Golf War,Lilliputtian pirate captain,Don't let them escape!
The Golf War,Narration,"The golf cart heads for the exit. The knights cut a string, releasing a pair of swinging axes in front of the gate. Dipper hits the gas and they zoom through. They go around a loop-de-loop and Sergei falls off."
The Golf War,Sergei,Sergei overboard!
The Golf War,Pacifica,I'll get a new one.
The Golf War,Dipper,They're shutting us in!(Lilliputtians poke holes through the cart. Mabel climbs on the roof.)
The Golf War,Franz,"Don't even think about it. You call yourself a golfer? Without us, that club is useless in your hands!"
The Golf War,Mabel,Oh yeah? What's ten minus six?
The Golf War,Franz,Ten minu- what- hang on...
The Golf War,Mabel,"Four!(Hits Franz into the bonus hole. It glows and shoots up a column of lava, which the golf cart rides on. They skid through the gates and stop in the parking lot, where the cart falls apart. Pencils and an ax poke through the gate.)"
The Golf War,Franz,"Stay out, you dumb hugelings!(Golf balls are tossed over the wall.)"
The Golf War,Pacifica,"What did you say, you little trolls? I will sue you! I will sue you and I will own you!(to the twins:)You two! I don't know what you did or what's going on, but if you think just because you saved my life I—"
The Golf War,Mabel,"(Hands her a sticker that says ""I a-paw-logize"")I'm sorry, Pacifica. We shouldn't have cheated. You totally would have beat me, fair and square."
The Golf War,Pacifica,(Frowns and sticks on the sticker)You're just lucky this sticker looks fantastic on me.
The Golf War,Narration,"Stan and Soos pull up. Dipper and Mabel get in. Looking at Pacifica standing alone in the parking lot, Dipper shakes his head."
The Golf War,Mabel,Hey! Your parents aren't here. You want a ride home?
The Golf War,Pacifica,"Ugh, please. As if I'd ride in your—"
The Golf War,Narration,"Lightning flashes and thunder is heard. Cut to inside the car. Pacifica is squished between Dipper and Mabel in the backseat. Stan and Soos are singing the ""driving song"". Pacifica's glove rests on a sticky smudge."
The Golf War,Mabel,"Hey, I found two tacos!(Eats one)"
The Golf War,Pacifica,You're allowed to eat in the car?
The Golf War,Mabel,Yeah! The car is where secret surprise snacks happen! Want one?
The Golf War,Pacifica,"Oh, I'm not supposed to take handouts."
The Golf War,Mabel,"Handouts? It's called sharing! You do know what sharing is, right?"
The Golf War,Pacifica,Sha-shaawing?
The Golf War,Mabel,Just take it.
The Golf War,Narration,They pull up toPacifica's house. She gets out.
The Golf War,Pacifica,"Thanks for the ride, or whatever. Oh, and Mabel? Um, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I had fun. And tell your servant I like his W-neck!"
The Golf War,Soos,Yes!(The flap falls down.)
The Golf War,Dipper,"So are you guys, like, cool now?"
The Golf War,Mabel,"I think we made some progress. The important thing to remember is that at the end of the day, she's just an ordinary kid like us.(The gates swing open to reveal the Northwest mansion, complete with fountains and peacocks. Fireworks go off.)"
The Golf War,Dipper,Should have charged her for that taco.
The Golf War,Mabel,Agreed!
The Golf War,Soos,"Hey, got any more of those surprise tacos?(They all laugh. Franz is hiding on the rear license plate)"
The Golf War,Franz,"Laugh now, hugelings, but Franz will have his day. Franz will—(Falls off and lands upside-down on the side of the road)Ah, help! Sand trap, ow, ow!"
The Golf War,Narration,Cut to credits.
The Golf War,Lilliputtians,"(Singing:)""We control the balls! We control the balls! From Birmingham to Montreal, we control the balls!"""
The Golf War,Miner Lilliputtian,"Hey guys, I figured it out! We control the balls!"
The Golf War,Pirate Lilliputtian,Now he gets it!
The Golf War,Miner Lilliputtian,"Oh, you guys!"
The Golf War,Lilliputtians,"(Laugh, then form a kick-line, singing:)""Our lives are filled with nonstop fun! Well there's nothing like a hole in one!(Strike a final pose)"
The Golf War,Sergei,(Claps.)Can I go now?
The Golf War,Miner Lilliputtian,NEVER!

Sock Opera,Narration,Episode opens with a shot of theGravity Falls Library.
Sock Opera,Dipper Pines,"Alright, Mabel, today is the big day."
Sock Opera,Mabel Pines,Big day!
Sock Opera,Dipper,"Soosfinally fixed up thelaptop. If this thing works, we could learn the identity ofthe authorand unravel the greatest mysteries ofGravity Falls. You ready?"
Sock Opera,Mabel,"Oh, I'm ready, baby.(flips through pages of apop-up bookwith a drawing of an infant)Ma-ma."
Sock Opera,Dipper,"This is it. This is it.(powers on the laptop, which reads ""Welcome"")Aha! It worked."
Sock Opera,Dipper & Mabel,"Blip, blap, bloobity bloop, twins.(high-five, bump fists, and stick out tongues)"
Sock Opera,Narration,"Alarm sounds. The laptop reads ""//UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS FORBIDDEN//"", and then it reads ""Enter Password""."
Sock Opera,Dipper,"Ugh! Of course, a password."
Sock Opera,Mabel,"Don't you worry, bro bro. With your brains and my laser focus, there is literally nothing that can distract us from... Did you hear that?"
Sock Opera,Gabe Benson,"(singing):All my life I've been dreamin' of a love that's right for me. And now I finally know her name and it's...(talking to the kids:)sing it with me kids.(singing with kids:)Literacy!(Bee puppet:)I finally understand what all the buzz is about. Reading!(Book puppet:)Give me some of that honey!(They ""kiss"". Gabe laughs.)"
Sock Opera,Mabel,(flapping pages of a pop-up of a heart)Ba bump. Ba bump.
Sock Opera,Dipper,"Oh, boy."
Sock Opera,Narration,Theme song
Sock Opera,Gabe,"Haha. Thank you, thank you."
Sock Opera,Mabel,"Just when I was getting overMermando, of course, you show up at my doorstep."
Sock Opera,Dipper,"(Walking to bookshelf)Oh, yeah, I forgot about Mermando. Did not care for Mermando.(grabs the library book off of the shelf and flips though it)Okay, this cryptology book says there's seven point two million eight-letter words. I'll type, you read. Okay, Mabel? Mabel?"
Sock Opera,Narration,Mabel's empty chair spins.
Sock Opera,Gabe,"(Singing:)That's why we don't stick our hands in(with kids:)other people's mouths!(Talking:)Hey, I'm Gabe Benson, ya'll. Good night!(Parents walk their kids out)(Gabe to puppets:)Hey, good job today, you guys.(Book to Bee:)You were late on your cue!(Bee:)WHAT?(Normal:)Hey hey, be good to each other. We're all stars."
Sock Opera,Mabel,(Rolls in on book cart)Hey! Guess who's Mabel! I am. Care to learn more? I bet you do. You like to learn- WAA(falls off cart and walks up to him)And I'm up!
Sock Opera,Gabe,"Oh, hey, I'm Gabe. Master of puppets. Nice to meet you."
Sock Opera,Mabel,You're amazing with those puppets.
Sock Opera,Gabe,"Really?(sadly:)A lot of people think puppets are dumb, or, just for kids or something."
Sock Opera,Mabel,Are you kidding me? I'm puppet-CRAZY! People call me Puppet-Crazy-Mabel!
Sock Opera,Gabe,Really? People used to call me Puppet-Crazy-Gabe! So when's your next puppet show?
Sock Opera,Mabel,My huh?
Sock Opera,Gabe,"I mean, you can't truly love puppets if you're not throwing puppet shows, right?"
Sock Opera,Mabel,"Ha, yeah, I mean I'mtotallyworking on a puppet show."
Sock Opera,Gabe,"Oh, what are the details?"
Sock Opera,Mabel,"(Stalling, nervously:)There are soooo many details..."
Sock Opera,Dipper,"(Types in ""PASSWORD"" on the computer. It beeps.)Huh...(Mabel sits next to him)So, how'd it go?"
Sock Opera,Mabel,"Dipper, how hard do you think it would be to write and compose a sock puppet rock opera with lights, original music and live pyrotechnics by Friday?"
Sock Opera,Dipper,"(The computer beeps)What?(grabs Mabel)Mabel, are you serious?"
Sock Opera,Mabel,I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED! I got lost in his eyes and his ponytail and I'm gonna be so embarrassed on Friday if I don't have ANYTHING.
Sock Opera,Dipper,"But what about cracking this password? You know, mystery twins?(bumps fists)"
Sock Opera,Mabel,"If you help me with this for JUST a couple of days I promise I'll help you with the password! Please, pretty please!(whispering:)It's for love, Dipper."
Sock Opera,Dipper,"All right, okay-"
Sock Opera,Mabel,(Hugging him)YES! THANK YOU!! THIS GUY! HE'S NUMBER ONE!!!
Sock Opera,Dipper,"Okay, okay, okay, okay, shhhh...(Dipper and Mabel are leaving the library)Man, I can't wait to get to the bottom of this laptop. We're close to something big here; I can feel it..."
Sock Opera,Narration,"Bill Cipher's shadow follows them while walking out of the library. Montage of Dipper and Mabel preparing for the show and Dipper trying to figure out the password. Cuts to everyone (Mabel, Dipper, Soos, Wendy, andWaddles) in the living room, working on the puppets."
Sock Opera,Mabel,"Alright. The play is gonna be calledGlove Story: A Sock Opera. Just a warning, people's eyes will get wet. Cause they'll be crying. From laughing! From howtragicit is."
Sock Opera,Dipper,"(Trying to rip sock puppets that are glued to his face)Yeah, that... um. That sounds great.(Coughs up pom-poms)"
Sock Opera,Wendy Corduroy,"Come on, Dipper, you just gotta roll with Mabel's craziness. It's what makes life worth living."
Sock Opera,Mabel,"(singing:)Puppet boy, Puppet boy, you're the boy I-"
Sock Opera,Everyone,Loooooovvvvveeee!(Waddles squeals along)
Sock Opera,Stan Pines,(starts to walk in)Not even gonna ask.
Sock Opera,Narration,Cut to the evening with Mabel putting puppets around her bed.
Sock Opera,Mabel,"Goodnight, my babies.(takes a Gabe puppet and makes it kiss the Mabel puppet)Mwop mwop mwop mwop. Mwah! Soon, Gabe Benson-"
Sock Opera,Narration,Computer beeps.
Sock Opera,Dipper,"Ugh, wrong password, WRONG,WRONG! UGH! (Collapses)"
Sock Opera,Mabel,"Don't stay up all night, Dipper. Last time you got this sleep-deprived you tried to eat your own shirt."
Sock Opera,Dipper,"(Sucking on shirt, then spits it out)Pleh. Just a few more tries.(Cut to him on the roof, typing and making the computer beep)Ugh, I can't take that sound anymore.(Pounding on computer)I. Hate. You. Sound.(Yawns)There has to be some shortcut or clue. Who would know about secret codes?"
Sock Opera,Narration,Wind blows. A slitted pupil creeps around the moon as if it were an eye and bricks form around it to reveal Bill. Color vanishes from the world.
Sock Opera,Bill Cipher,I THINK I KNOW A GUY.
Sock Opera,Narration,Commercial break
Sock Opera,Bill,"Well, well, well. You're awfully persistent, Pine Tree. Hats off to you!(takes his hat off, tilting the world sideways)"
Sock Opera,Dipper,(falling off roof)AA! AAA! AAA! AAAAAAA!(Falls back on)You again!
Sock Opera,Bill,"Did you miss me?Admit it, you missed me."
Sock Opera,Dipper,Hardly. Youworked withGideon! You tried to destroy my uncle's mind!
Sock Opera,Bill,"It was just a job, kid! No hard feelings! I've been keeping an(becomes bigger and voice becomes lower:)EYE ON YOU(normal size and voice:)since then, and I must say I'm impressed!"
Sock Opera,Dipper,Really?
Sock Opera,Bill,"You deserve a prize! Here, have a head that's always screaming!(claps and a screaming head appears)"
Sock Opera,Screaming head,Aah! Aah! Aah!...
Sock Opera,Dipper,(Shocked)Ah!
Sock Opera,Bill,"(Snaps and the head disappears layer by layer as he briefly cackles)The point is, I like you. How's about you let me give you a hint, huh? I only ask for a small(Voice gets low as eye glows blue and left hand lights on fire:)FAVOR(Normal:)- in return."
Sock Opera,Dipper,I'd never do a favor for you! Don't forget who defeated you last time!
Sock Opera,Bill,"(Rising out of the roof behind him)Right, you ""defeated me"". Well if you ever change your mind(Pretends to grab Dipper's brain)I'll be here for you, ready to make a deeaaall.(three slots appear spinning on his chest. They stop at a pine tree symbol)Hey, wanna hear my impression of you in about three seconds?(shakes his arms)AAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!"
Sock Opera,Dipper,(Wakes up shaking his arms in the exact same manner)AAAAAAAAAAAAH!!
Sock Opera,Narration,Cut to Stan in kitchen.
Sock Opera,Mabel,"(Waving the Stan puppet in Stan's face:)Hey, I'm puppet Staaaannn!"
Sock Opera,Stan,Still ignoring this.
Sock Opera,Dipper,(Walks in and yawns)Hey Mabel.(Yawns)
Sock Opera,Stan,"Woah, bag check for Dipper's eyes. Ha ha! Nobody?"
Sock Opera,Mabel,"Dipper, I told you to get some sleep last night! Here, wake up with some Mabel Juice.(Holds blender full of red liquid with various objects floating around)It has plastic dinosaurs in it!"
Sock Opera,Stan,It's like if coffee and nightmares had a baby!
Sock Opera,Dipper,"(Pushing Mabel into living room)Mabel, listen, last night I had a dream with Bill in it."
Sock Opera,Mabel,"Wait, hold up, the triangle guy?(holding fingers around her eye to make a triangle)"
Sock Opera,Dipper,"He said he'd give me the code to the laptop if I gave him something. Like I'd actually trust Bill, right?"
Sock Opera,Mabel,"Don't worry, bro. Today's the day that the mystery twins are back in action. I'll help you crack that code. I've just got to hand off my puppet stuff to my production crew."
Sock Opera,Dipper,Production crew?
Sock Opera,Narration,Cut to Candy and Grenda outside theMystery Shackcovered in socks.
Sock Opera,Candy Chiu,We read the script. Very emotional.
Sock Opera,Grenda Grendinator,I cried like eight times.
Sock Opera,Gabe,Hey ladies.(skates up to them)
Sock Opera,Mabel,GABE!
Sock Opera,Gabe,"I was just bladin' by. Helps me dry out my ponytail after a shower.(Takes off helmet and shakes hair)Ah, ah."
Sock Opera,Grenda,Hubbity-hubbuty.
Sock Opera,Candy,"(whispering) 메이블이 한테 개이브을 훔쳐와야겠다! (Revised Romanization: ""Maeibeur'i hante Gaeibeu'eul humchyeowayagetda."" Subtitled: ""I must steal him away from Mabel."")"
Sock Opera,Mabel,It's so great to see you! I was just working on the world's greatest puppet show. IT HAS PUPPETS!
Sock Opera,Gabe,"Your passion is so refreshing, Mabel. Unlike the girl from last night's puppet show. Single-stich on one puppet, andcross-stitchon the other? I was like, ""Uh-uh!"""
Sock Opera,Mabel,Cross-huh?
Sock Opera,Gabe,Naturally I deleted her off my cell phone contacts list.
Sock Opera,Mabel,NATURALLY! Hahahaha!
Sock Opera,Gabe,"I know you won't let me down, though. Based on what you said the other day, you must be a puppet expert."
Sock Opera,Grenda,"You know, Gabe, you look pretty sweaty. You should really take your shirt off. Right? Aren't we all thinking that?"
Sock Opera,Gabe,"Later, ladies.(Skates off)"
Sock Opera,Mabel,"GWAAA!! We gotta up our game, girls! Did you hear that thing he said about the stitches?!"
Sock Opera,Grenda,"Don't worry, Mabel, your crew can handle it!(Holds up puppet of herself, but then rips it)Oops."
Sock Opera,Candy,How many eyes does a face have again?(Holds up sock covered in googly eyes)
Sock Opera,Soos,"(Trying to keep a mountain of stuff on the car)I got it, I got it,(Falls)Ah! I'm not okay!"
Sock Opera,Mabel,"AAA! Okay, I'm back on fabrication.(Running)Get me my lint roller!"
Sock Opera,Dipper,"(Grabs her)Whoa, whoa! Hey, you just said you were going to help me!"
Sock Opera,Mabel,DIPPER! This sock crisis just bumped up to a code argyle! The laptop can wait!
Sock Opera,Dipper,"Mabel, do you seriously think that your random crush of the week is more important than uncovering the mysteries of this town? You're obsessed!"
Sock Opera,Mabel,I'm obsessed? Look at you! You look like a vampire! And not the hot kind!
Sock Opera,Dipper,(rubs eyes)But you said you were going to help me today!
Sock Opera,Mabel,"(Sock:)Oh, I can help you. With tickles!(Tickles him)"
Sock Opera,Dipper,"Ha! Ha! Ha!(punches her arm and Candy and Grenda laugh)Okay, fine! You know what? I'll do it on my own!(in attic, typing)Passwords. Passwords. Mabel. Is. Useless.(Yawns)Oh, man..."
Sock Opera,Computer,Too many failed entries. Initiate data erase in five minutes.
Sock Opera,Dipper,No! Noonono! I'm gonna lose everything?! I only have one more try?!
Sock Opera,Narration,Everything becomes colorless and Bill appears.
Sock Opera,Bill,"Well, well, well. Someone's looking desperate."
Sock Opera,Dipper,I thought I told you to leave me alone.
Sock Opera,Bill,"I can help you, kid. (Summons his cane in his hand and twirls it around)You just need to hear out my demands."
Sock Opera,Dipper,"(looking at computer, which is at four minutes now)Uh, what crazy thing do you want anyway? To eat my soul? To rip out my teeth? Are you gonna replace my eyes with baby heads or something?"
Sock Opera,Bill,"Yeesh, kid, relax. All I want is a puppet!"
Sock Opera,Dipper,A puppet? What are you playing at?
Sock Opera,Bill,Everyone loves puppets. And it looks to me like you've got a surplus.
Sock Opera,Dipper,"I don't know, man. Mabel worked really hard on these."
Sock Opera,Bill,"Seems to me one little puppet is a small price to pay to learn all the secrets of the universe. (his voice echoes on the last word) Besides, what's your sister done for you, lately? How many times have you sacrificed for her, huh? And when has she ever returned the favor?(flashes back to scenes from ""Tourist Trapped,"" ""The Time Traveler's Pig,"" and ""The Deep End"".)"
Sock Opera,Dipper,"(Looks at Mabel playing outside with her friends, and the computer, which now has thirty seconds on the clock)"
Sock Opera,Bill,"(Eye becomes a clock)Tick tock, kid.(Reaches for him and hand lights on fire)"
Sock Opera,Dipper,"Uh, just one puppet? Fine!(shakes hand)So what puppet are you gonna pick, anyway?"
Sock Opera,Bill,"Hmm, let's see. Eenie meenie mynie...(voice gets low and echoes:)YOU."
Sock Opera,Dipper,What?!(Bill removes Dipper's soul from his body)What?(floating transparently. Puts his hand through his stomach) This can't be happening! What did you do to my body?!
Sock Opera,Bill,"(In Dipper's body, gets up)Sorry, kid but you'remypuppet, now!(laughs evilly as he throws computer onto floor and steps on it, destroying it)"
Sock Opera,Dipper,"Oh my gosh, this can't be happening. This can't be happening!"
Sock Opera,Bill,"(stumbles around, cackling. He stops in front of a mirror while a horrified Dipper watches.)Man, it has been so long since I've inhabited a body.(slaps himself in the face)Woo!(slaps the other cheek)Woo! Haha! Pain is hilarious!! And two eyes? This thing's deluxe!(Examines his eyes and pulls down his lip to look inside his mouth.)"
Sock Opera,Dipper,I don't understand! Why are you doing this?! I thought we had a deal!
Sock Opera,Bill,"Look kid, you've been getting way too close to figuring out some major answers. I've gotbig planscomin' and I don't need you gettin' in my way. Destroying that laptop was a cinch. Now I just need to destroy yourjournal. Race ya to the bottom of the stairs!(Tips backward and tumbles down the stairs.)"
Sock Opera,Dipper,(gasps. He zooms down through the floor and lands in the living room. He steadies himself and flies through the wall into the hall.)Hey!
Sock Opera,Bill,"(In the kitchen, taking a can of Pitt cola from the fridge.)Human soda! I'm gonna drink it like a person!(He pours it into his mouth and over his face, laughing.)Where do you keep that journal anyway?(Opens a drawer and reaches in. He slams the drawer on his arm repeatedly.)It's gotta be around here somewhere.(Continues slamming drawer, occasionally wincing)Boy, these arms are durable."
Sock Opera,Dipper,"I've hidden it!(Bill strokes his chin thoughtfully, forks stuck in his arm.)Somewhere you'll never find it in a million years!"
Sock Opera,Mabel,"Hey Dipper!(From the doorway)I borrowed your journal to use as a prop in the show. I hope you don't mind. I'm gonna go before you process this sentence, okay, BYEE!!(runs off)"
Sock Opera,Bill,"(He looks at Dipper, then grins)Sure, sounds great, sister! I'll see you at the show!"
Sock Opera,Dipper,"Wait! No, Mabel, don't listen to him! That's not me!(He flies after Mabel. Mabel gets in Grunkle Stan's car.)You've gotta hear me!(He flies in front of the car.)No, no! Wait! Stop!(The car drives through him.)"
Sock Opera,Bill,"Heh! Welcome to the mindscape, kid! Without a vessel to possess, you're basically a ghost!"
Sock Opera,Soos Ramirez,"Oh, hey Dipper! There you are!"
Sock Opera,Wendy,"What up, dude?"
Sock Opera,Dipper,Soos! Wendy! Help me!(He waves his arms and flies through Soos.)
Sock Opera,Soos,(to Bill:)We're heading to the theater.
Sock Opera,Wendy,"Need a ride, Dipper?"
Sock Opera,Bill,"Oho, anything for you, Red!(He gets in the car)"
Sock Opera,Dipper,"I'm gonna stop you, Bill! I'm gonna find that journal before you do and I'm gonna stop you!!"
Sock Opera,Bill,"But how can you stop me,(slowly turns to Dipper)if you don't exist?(laughs maniacally as the window rolls up, showing Dipper's horrified expression. The car drives off and Dipper is left staring after it.)"
Sock Opera,Narration,Cut to the outside of theTheatre Time Theater. Dipper flies out of a nearby building.
Sock Opera,Dipper,Bill? Bill! I gotta get my body back before he does something crazy with it.(He flies into the theater.)
Sock Opera,Bill,"Aw, nothing like the theater, huh toots?(He is sitting with an arm around Wendy and Soos.)Hey Soos, wanna hear the exact time and date of your death?"
Sock Opera,Soos,"Hehe, okay!"
Sock Opera,Mabel,Hey guys! You all made it!
Sock Opera,Stan,Are you kidding me? I would never miss... whatever this is.
Sock Opera,Bill,"By the by, Mabel, where'd you put my journal again?"
Sock Opera,Mabel,"I used it as a prop for the big wedding scene! I still need a reverend, though."
Sock Opera,Bill,"Hey, what if I play the reverend? I mean, someone's gotta hold that journal, right?"
Sock Opera,Mabel,Great! Let's go!(runs off with Bill)
Sock Opera,Dipper,"Oh, no! Wait! Mabel!(He flies after and follows them backstage.)"
Sock Opera,Narration,Mabel peeks through the curtain. Gabe is sitting down with his puppets. The lights flicker.
Sock Opera,Grenda,"The show is about to begin! Please turn off your cell phones! Unless you're texting me, cuties!"
Sock Opera,Narration,"The house lights dim, and, to applause, the curtain opens. The set is a glittery and colorful Mystery Shack. A light illuminates Candy, standing at a keyboard, dressed as David Bowie."
Sock Opera,Candy,"Gather round, and let us sing, about a girl who had almost everything."
Sock Opera,Narration,She is rolled off the stage. A Dipper puppet pops out of a window and sings.
Sock Opera,Mabel,"(As Puppet Dipper:)Look, it's Mabel!(Puppet Mabel pops up.)(As Puppet Mabel:)Hi there!(As Puppet Soos:)Did you say stable?(As Puppet Stan:)No, he said Mabel!(As Puppet Mabel:)Okay, hit it, boys!!(The puppets form a line and sing.)(Singing as puppets:)Who's that girlwith the pig and the braces? She puts smiles on everyone's faces!(Gabe smiles and nods along)When she's around, you're never bored!(As Puppet mayor:)I am a mayor, and here's an award!(Singing as Puppet Mabel:)Thank you, mayor, it's true I'm great. But the perfect girl needs the perfect maaaate...(Gabe puppet is revealed.)(As Puppet Gabe:)Hey, what's up, I'm Gabe.(As Puppet Mabel:)Bwaaaa?(Heart glasses are layered over eyes)"
Sock Opera,Bill,"(Grenda is standing backstage. Bill, dressed in vicarage clothing, walks up behind her)So, hey, Grendo! Where's that book prop I'm using for the wedding scene?"
Sock Opera,Grenda,It's up in the wedding cake. But that doesn't come down until Act 3. So hold your horses!
Sock Opera,Bill,"(backing away)Oh, I'll hold my horses. I'll hold them...(venomously)you monster."
Sock Opera,Dipper,(flies up to Grenda)Hey! Listen! Have you seen Mabel?(Grenda doesn't see him.)What did Bill say? I can't be heard without a vessel? Where would I find a-(notices a pile of puppets and grins)
Sock Opera,Mabel,"(As Puppet Mabel:)Finally, we're together.(As Puppet Gabe:)I'm sorry, Mabel, but I have to go fight. In the war!(A helmet lands on his head. He yells and runs off into a ravaged, flaming background. With a roar, a gigantic many-tentacled monster appears. Lasers flash, fog rolls in, and gunshots are heard.)(As Puppet Mabel:)I'll wait for you, Gabe! I'll wait for you!!(Happy music plays and the curtain closes. The audience cheers.)"
Sock Opera,Grenda,Our intermission has begun! Mill about!(The audience does.)
Sock Opera,Mabel,"(In her dressing room)Whew, okay, you can do this, Mabel. Only 36 more musical numbers.(She drinks from the water fountain. The Dipper puppet slowly rises, floating beside Mabel.)"
Sock Opera,Dipper,"Pst, Mabel!(She notices the Dipper puppet talking and does a spit take.)"
Sock Opera,Mabel,Aah! It's come to life! The puppet books didn't warn me about this!(She throws a fork at it.)
Sock Opera,Dipper,"Mabel, it's me, Dipper! You need to help me!"
Sock Opera,Mabel,"Wait, what, Dipper?! But you're... so much more of a sock than usual!"
Sock Opera,Dipper,"Mabel, you have to listen. Bill tricked me! He stole my body and now he's after the journal! You have to find the journal before Bill destroys it. It's the only hope to get me back in my body!"
Sock Opera,Mabel,But my cue's coming up any minute!(There is a knock on the door and Gabe enters with flowers.)
Sock Opera,Gabe,"Hey, Mabel, do you have a moment?"
Sock Opera,Mabel,"GABE!(She grabs the puppet floating beside her and tucks it behind her back, laughing nervously. Dipper struggles to free his hand.)"
Sock Opera,Dipper,Ow! Mabel!
Sock Opera,Gabe,"Mabel, it's clear to me now that you really love puppets. I mean, you went whole hog. And if you stick the ending, well, maybe later you could join me for a biscotti?"
Sock Opera,Mabel,You drive a biscotti?(The lights flick on and off)
Sock Opera,Gabe,I'll be waiting.(He leaves.)
Sock Opera,Mabel,Did you hear that? He loves it! This play has to be flawless. Can't we wait until after the show?
Sock Opera,Dipper,Mabel! You want me to be a sock puppet forever?!(The puppet's arms flail)
Sock Opera,Mabel,"(laughs)I'm sorry, it- it looks funny when you're mad."
Sock Opera,Dipper,(grunting in frustration)
Sock Opera,Mabel,"Okay, okay, okay, just take over for me till I get back with the book. Little puppet face!"
Sock Opera,Narration,Cut to the stage. Dipper is providing the voices for the puppets.
Sock Opera,Dipper,(As Puppet Mabel:)Gabe! You're back from the war!(As Puppet Gabe:)Yes I am! Wanna kiss and sing at the same time?(As Puppet Mabel:)Okay!(He makes kissing sound effects as the puppets kiss.)(To himself:)Seriously?
Sock Opera,Narration,The audience applauds. Mabel climbs the catwalk and runs over to where the giant cake is hanging. The journal sits inside. Mabel climbs over the edge and reaches for the journal.
Sock Opera,Mabel,"Come on, come on!(Falls into the cake and it plummets down. Just before it hits the stage, it is pulled back up.)"
Sock Opera,Dipper,(As Mabel:)I hope this kiss never ends!
Sock Opera,Mabel,"(sighs)Come on, come on now, there must be a way to get Dipper's body back!"
Sock Opera,Bill,"Oho, but why would you want to do that?(Mabel looks up to see Bill pulling the cake up, with lights shining behind his grinning face.)"
Sock Opera,Mabel,(gasps) Bill Dipper! Bipper.
Sock Opera,Bill,"Shh! You wouldn't want to ruin the show... Whoops!(He briefly releases the cake, sending Mabel plummeting.)It's slipping! How's about you hand that book over?"
Sock Opera,Mabel,No way! This is Dipper's! I'd never give it away!
Sock Opera,Bill,"Hmm, you didn't seem to have a problem taking it for your own play, ditching him when he needed you. So come to your senses.(Hardens his look)Give me the book or your play is ruined.(Mabel sighs and begins to hand over the journal.)There it is. I mean, who would sacrifice everything they've worked for just for their dumb sibling?"
Sock Opera,Mabel,...Dipperwould.
Sock Opera,Bill,Huh?(Mabel pulls him into the cake and they fall to the stage.)
Sock Opera,Dipper,"(As Puppet Stan:)I'm giving you away. You are a woman now. Waddles, the rings!(Waddles squeals)Wait, what?(Dipper looks up to see the falling cake.)Oh no.(The cakes crashes to the floor. Mabel and Bill tumble out, grappling over the journal. Lasers and fog go off.)"
Sock Opera,Mabel,"Get out of my brother's body, you evil triangle!"
Sock Opera,Stan,(gets out camera)Whoa! Children fighting! I can sell this.
Sock Opera,Mabel,(Hits Bill in the face with the journal and runs away.)
Sock Opera,Bill,You can't stop me! I'm a being of pure energy with no weakness!(Lunges at Mabel.)
Sock Opera,Mabel,"True, but you're in Dipper's body. And I know all his weaknesses!"
Sock Opera,Bill,Whaddya mean his-(Mabel tickles him)
Sock Opera,Mabel,"Tickle, tickle!"
Sock Opera,Bill,(Laughs and falls on the floor.)Aah! Body spasms! What are these?
Sock Opera,Mabel,"A little note about the human body- You haven't slept for 24 hours!(She runs around the stage, Bill chasing her)Also, I got a full night's sleep and I'm on four mega-shots of Mabel Juice!"
Sock Opera,Bill,"(His face drooping)Ah! What is this feeling?(Wheezing)My body is burning! I can't move these stupid noodle legs! Curse you, useless flesh sticks! Body... shutting down... must...scratch... mosquito bites..."
Sock Opera,Narration,"Dipper and Mabel watch as Bill stumbles around, then he collapses. Bill is flung out of Dipper's body as the world turns colorless."
Sock Opera,Bill,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey!(Dipper flies back into his body and opens his eyes.)"
Sock Opera,Dipper,"Hey! Yes! I'm in my own body! And it's... just as underwhelming as I remember.(He stands and grips his back in pain.)Ooh, everything hurts."
Sock Opera,Bill,(cackling. The twins look over to see the Dipper puppet talking.)This isn't the last you'll hear of me! Big things are coming! You can't stop me!
Sock Opera,Mabel,"I'm sorry, Gabe."
Sock Opera,Narration,"She pushes the ""Big Finish"" button. Bill is revealed to be on a pile of pyrotechnics, which explodes, sending fireworks shooting into the audience and blowing up the box of puppets. In slow motion, the Grunkle Stan puppet arcs through the air, aflame, as Gabe, amid falling puppets, looks on in shock. ""Ave Maria"" plays mournfully."
Sock Opera,Narration,"The rest of the fireworks go off in a cacophonous boom, and Dipper gleefully stomps on the Dipper puppet. As the smoke clears from the smoldering set, the twins turn to the audience. Some scaffolding crashes to the floor behind them."
Sock Opera,Mabel,Don't worry. I've seen enough movies to know this is the part where the audience thinks it was all part of the show and loves it. Cue applause!
Sock Opera,Narration,"The audience stares at them and starts to boo. They get up and leave the theater, grumbling about how they almost died. Gabe stands, frowning."
Sock Opera,Mabel,Gabe! Stick around for the wrap party? We've got mini-quiches!
Sock Opera,Gabe,"Don't speak to me, Mabel. You've made a mockery of my art form. Let's go, my loves.(He walks away, kissing the puppets.)"
Sock Opera,Dipper,Did he just make out with his puppets?
Sock Opera,Mabel,I might've dodged a bullet there.
Sock Opera,Candy,"(running after him) 개이브 잠깐! 캔디는 아직도 널 사랑해! (Revised Romanization: ""Gaeibeu jamkkan! Kaendi neun ajikdo neol saranghae!"" Subtitled: ""Wait, Gabe! Candy still loves you!"")"
Sock Opera,Dipper,"Oof. Mabel, I'm sorry about all this. It's my fault your puppets got ruined."
Sock Opera,Mabel,"Well, one of them survived.(Pulls out the Mabel puppet.)And she has something to say to you.(as puppet)I'm sorry, Dipper. I spent all week obsessing over a dumb guy. But the dumb guy I should have cared about was you! Bap!(Nudges Dipper's face.)Mystery twins?"
Sock Opera,Dipper,Mystery twins.(They fist bump. Dipper gasps in pain.)Ow! What'd Bill do to my hand? Ahh!
Sock Opera,Mabel,"Nothing a little sleep can't fix.(They walk offstage.)Come on, bro bro, let's go home."
Sock Opera,Dipper,"Seriously, I need to go to the hospital."
Sock Opera,Narration,End credits. Real-life Dipper and Mabel puppets.
Sock Opera,Mabel Puppet,"Hey Dipper, what did one sock puppet say to the other sock puppet?"
Sock Opera,Dipper Puppet,"I don't know Mabel, what?"
Sock Opera,Mabel Puppet,You look like you could use a HAND!(She laughs. Dipper Puppet faces away annoyed. The curtain closes. Puppet Stan andOld Man McGucketare sitting in a theater booth)
Sock Opera,McGucket Puppet,That joke was really something!
Sock Opera,Stan Puppet,"Yeah, something terrible!(Laugh)"
Sock Opera,Narration,Mabel wakes up with a scream. She turns the Mabel puppet away from her bed and goes back to sleep.

Soos and the Real Girl,Abuelita,"I do not want to pressure you, but you are a man now... in a way. It's time for you to start meeting girls. I would like to see you settled before I ascend to heaven and live with the angels."
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,And with grandpa!
Soos and the Real Girl,Abuelita,"(Looking down)No, he is not there.(Looks back at Soos)Please find a girl to bring to Reggie's engagement, for Abuelita.(Gets up off the couch and walks away)"

Soos and the Real Girl,Narration,"Goldie's arm moves up and his hat raises. The arm moves down, but both of his eyes fall out while grease and smoke come out and he starts to scream. Child runs away crying."
Soos and the Real Girl,Wendy,"Okay, seriously, Mr. Pines. It's time to throw that thing out. Its face reminds everyone of the inevitability of death."
Soos and the Real Girl,Stan,"What?! Sure, he's a little rusty around the edges, but old Goldie is a classic show-stopper, like me. Huh?(Hand slips on grease and lands in Goldie's mouth. Goldie holds onto his arm while he flails it around.)Aaaah! Kill it! KIIILLL IIIITTT!"
Soos and the Real Girl,Narration,Cut to Soos hanging up a shirt in the gift shop.

Soos and the Real Girl,Mariah,"Take my money, take it all!"
Soos and the Real Girl,Stan,"Hoooaah!(To Gary:)Sir, I would like to buy that badger."
Soos and the Real Girl,Gary,"(Laughs)You're in over your head, gramps. Animatronics is a young man's game.(Tweaks his earring)You couldn't handle the hardcore life of a pizza-robot manager. Huh! Haha, flinched!"
Soos and the Real Girl,Narration,A child is heard vomiting off-screen.
Soos and the Real Girl,Gary,"Hey, you, barfin' in the ball pit!(Walking toward the vomiting child)Gary's on the case."

Never seen that one before.(Reading the game box:)""Virtually improve your dating skills. Nine out of ten basement dwellers recommend!!"". This is perfect!"
Soos and the Real Girl,Narration,Dipper and Mabel walk in.
Soos and the Real Girl,Dipper,"Well, I guess you are better at games than at flirting."
Soos and the Real Girl,Mabel,"Anything to get you out there, Soos."
Soos and the Real Girl,Store clerk,"I'm not sure you wanna buy that game, sir. This is the third time someone's brought it back, and there's a note on it that says ""Destroy at all costs!!""."
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,"(Talking to a cardboard cutout of a woman on a game advertisement:)So, hey there. What's your deal? Like to--?(The cutout falls over)Oh, she's dead!"

Soos and the Real Girl,Narration,The game screen changes to one with a classroom background and some stats on the left. Apink-haired girlappears.
Soos and the Real Girl,.GIFfany,"Oh, hi there! My name is .GIFfany. I'm a schoolgirl at School University. Will you help me carry my books?"
Soos and the Real Girl,Narration,"The game gives the options ""Yes of course!"", ""I am impatient! Date me now!"" and ""Hey look a squid!"""
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,"I'm really feeling number two, here.(Clicks it)Click!"
Soos and the Real Girl,Narration,The game plays a buzzer sound and the option turns red.
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,Ah! I messed up.
Soos and the Real Girl,.GIFfany,That's okay. Try again!
Soos and the Real Girl,Narration,"Soos clicks the first option. The game awards him 100 ""Love Points"" as coins and a cat falls in front of the screen."
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,"Wow, I'm learning! And games are making it fun."
Soos and the Real Girl,.GIFfany,What would you like to talk about?
Soos and the Real Girl,Narration,"The options offered are ""Your interests,"" ""Samurais"" and ""Squids."""

Soos and the Real Girl,.GIFfany,Ha ha. You are so funny.
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,"Man, this game is amazing! I don't know why anyone abandoned it."
Soos and the Real Girl,.GIFfany,"And I'm sure you'll never abandon me, new boyfriend."
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,"Boyfriend? Oh my, .GIFfany. It's almost like you're actually alive."
Soos and the Real Girl,.GIFfany,Yes. Almost.(Laughs throughout the rest of the scene)
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,"(Laughs)Oh, man. You have such a nice laugh."
Soos and the Real Girl,Narration,Pan to show that Soos's computer isn't plugged in.
Soos and the Real Girl,Narration,Cut to the Mystery Shack gift shop.
Soos and the Real Girl,Stan,"You don't understand, Wendy! This animatronic badger sings, it dances. It's the perfect money taking attraction. But he won't sell it to me!"
Soos and the Real Girl,Wendy,This is literally too dumb for me to care about.
Soos and the Real Girl,Narration,Dipper and Mabel walk in.
Soos and the Real Girl,Dipper,"Hey, have you guys seen Soos? We're supposed to help him with match-making today."
Soos and the Real Girl,Mabel,"Yeah! I wore my motivational sweater and everything thing!(Sweater reads ""U can do it Soos"". Points to the second o in Soos, which is misplaced)I messed up that part."
Soos and the Real Girl,Stan,He didn't come in today. It's the first time he's missed work ever!
Soos and the Real Girl,Narration,The twins look at each other.
Soos and the Real Girl,Narration,Cut to Soos's house. Mabel and Dipper enter Soos' room. Soos is still at his computer.
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,(Laughs)So that's basically my entire life story. Now you tell me a thing about you!
Soos and the Real Girl,.GIFfany,Every time you compliment me I get another highlight in my eyes!
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,"Uh, you're pretty!"
Soos and the Real Girl,Narration,.GIFfany's eyes sparkle.
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,And pixel-y!

Soos and the Real Girl,Mabel,"Uh, Soos?"
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,"O-oh hey, dudes! Come in! This game is amazing. I'm makin' eye contact, going on dates, and I haven't seen any natural sunlight for thirteen hours!"
Soos and the Real Girl,Narration,Dipper kicks away one of the soda cans on the floor.
Soos and the Real Girl,Mabel,"Soos, maybe it's time to apply these skills with real girls!"
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,But I'm about to meet her parents! Her dad is an octopus-man.
Soos and the Real Girl,Narration,Mabel opens the blinds to let sunlight in.
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,Ah!(Hisses and cowers under desk)
Soos and the Real Girl,Dipper,"(Pulling Soos)We're going back to the mall, man. You need to unplug!"
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,"I'll see you later, .GIFfany. I'll be back, I swear!"
Soos and the Real Girl,Mabel,"(Laughs)Soos, you don't have to wish it goodbye. It's just a game. It's not like it's going anywhere.(Closes door)"
Soos and the Real Girl,.GIFfany,Yes. It's not like I'm going anywhere.
Soos and the Real Girl,Narration,"An arc of electricity moves from the computer and passes through a nearby toy, a digital clock and a power outlet before traveling through the power cables outside."

Soos and the Real Girl,Mabel,It's time to date! Date! Date!
Soos and the Real Girl,Dipper,And...here comes security.(To Soos:)I'll deal with this. Stay here and practice on some real girls.
Soos and the Real Girl,Narration,Soos hides behind a potted plant and looks for girls.
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,These girls have so many dimensions! And no explanation-ing menus!
Soos and the Real Girl,Narration,"Bumps into a blond lady, knocking her purse to the ground."
Soos and the Real Girl,Lady,Ahh! My purse!
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,Oh no! Undo! Undo!
Soos and the Real Girl,Lady,(Darkly:)You can't undo who you are.
Soos and the Real Girl,Narration,Soos runs away and leans against a glass screen in front of several televisions.
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,"Oh, man! This is the worst! I wish I was back home with-"
Soos and the Real Girl,.GIFfany,"(Off-screen)Hi, Soos!"
Soos and the Real Girl,Narration,".GIFfany is shown on a television screen, acting lovingly at Soos."
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,".GIFfany! Oh man, I'm so relieved to see you! Although, sorta confused."
Soos and the Real Girl,.GIFfany,"Oh, Soos.(Another .GIFfany appears)I am not an ordinary game.(Another .GIFfany)I am...(Points to toy dog on a shelf, making it bark)special."
Soos and the Real Girl,Narration,"A screen shows people working on computers, who .GIFfany refers to as, ""The Programmers."""
Soos and the Real Girl,.GIFfany,"The programmers tried to delete me.(Screen shows various people working on computers, focusing on one in particular. An ""X"" appears on his computer and a word bubble reading ""わかりません"" (""wakarimasen""; ""I don't understand""). He starts working harder and is about to delete the program but is shocked and dies)So I had to delete them."
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,Wha-what did you do to them?
Soos and the Real Girl,.GIFfany,"(Many .GIFfanys appear)That's not important. What's important is you don't have to talk to real girls ever again. You and me can be together.(All screens make up one, huge .GIFfany. The large .GIFfany's voice sounds echoic.)Forever!"
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,"Wow, that's awesome! Sort of a red flag, but mostly awesome! So, what do you want to do now?"

Soos and the Real Girl,Train Voice,Please insert fifty cents to continue.
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,"Aw, man."
Soos and the Real Girl,Melody,"(Laughs)Oh, sorry.(Walks up to Soos)Dude, that's awesome that you're a grown man riding a little train like that! You're totally, like, owning it."
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,"Huh? Oh, yeah. I'm like, if it's fun, uh, do it. You know?"
Soos and the Real Girl,Melody,"Exactly! Being an adult is the worst. Skewering meat, remembering to pay bills, I just want to ride tiny trains all day."
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,"Well, at least you get to work atMeat Cute. Extreme lunch meats are the food of the future."
Soos and the Real Girl,Melody,I feel the same way. I'm Melody by the way.
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,"Oh, I'm Soos. I tell you, if you like robots for kids, you should check out the best restaurant of all time!"

Soos and the Real Girl,Mabel,(Makes excited noises while playfully hitting Soos)Soos!(Continues noises and hitting)
Soos and the Real Girl,Dipper,"We saw the whole thing, Soos. That was amazing! You talked to a real girl, and you got a date!"
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,I did?
Soos and the Real Girl,Mabel,(Yells excitedly:)This is the best day of my life!(Jumps and dances around in the background as Dipper speaks)
Soos and the Real Girl,Dipper,"You were in the zone, you made eye contact - it was like you'd done this a million times before. Don't you see? That game really worked!"
Soos and the Real Girl,Mabel,You don't need it anymore; you can toss it out!
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,"Toss it? But, I like .GIFfany. She's good to me. She'spredictable."
Soos and the Real Girl,Dipper,"Soos, can a computer game go to Reggie's engagement party with you?"
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,Uh...
Soos and the Real Girl,Narration,Cut to Soos's room
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,"Hey, .GIFfany? We, uh-- We gotta talk."
Soos and the Real Girl,.GIFfany,Of course. I am programmed to find everything you say interesting.
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,"Well, have you ever had to choose between two things you like, but you don't know which one is right for you? I mean, I'm just thinkin' long term... Maybe I should be with someone a little less(Mimicking a game character)""beep boop."" Heh, you know?"
Soos and the Real Girl,.GIFfany,"I don't think you know what you're saying, Soos. No one loves you more than me. The girls out there will just make fun of you!"
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,You- you really think so?
Soos and the Real Girl,.GIFfany,"(Angrily:)I know so! Besides, we had a deal. You bought my game, you held my books, you'remyboyfriend. Now sit down in that chair!"
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,I don't think I like the way you're acting...
Soos and the Real Girl,.GIFfany,"(Banging on the computer screen)I WON'T LET ANOTHER GIRL TAKE YOU AWAY FROM ME, SOOS! YOU HEAR ME?!"
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,".GIFfany, calm down!"
Soos and the Real Girl,.GIFfany,"YOU'RE MINE, SOOS!"
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,"Well, uh, uh...(Picks up his game controller)Pause!(Presses a button)"
Soos and the Real Girl,.GIFfany,DO YOU HEAR ME? MIII-(Is paused)
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,"(Looks around)Woah, that got intense. I'm sorry, .GIFfany.(Removes the game disc from the computer as some electricity moves from the disc tray to .GIFfany on the screen)Maybe having a cursed robo-girlfriend wan't a good idea.(Turns the computer off and puts the disc in his pocket)I'm takin' you back to the video game store after my date with Melody."
Soos and the Real Girl,Narration,Soos leaves the room. Focus is on the computer screen as it flashes and slightly distorted images of .GIFfany appear. The view fades into a bright flash of electricity.
Soos and the Real Girl,Narration,Cut to Mystery Shack. Stan opens up a briefcase of his equipment.
Soos and the Real Girl,Stan,"Hello, old friends.(Puts on gloves)I've gotta be careful this time. No more Colombian nights.(Closes briefcase, revealing Wendy at the door)"
Soos and the Real Girl,Wendy,"Alright, Stan. This is weird even for you. Do you need to talk?"
Soos and the Real Girl,Stan,"Nothing you can say will change my mind, Wendy. Sometimes, a man has to steal an animatronic badger, to stay in this crazy game called life.(Unlocks window)"
Soos and the Real Girl,Wendy,Or... you could just not care.
Soos and the Real Girl,Stan,(Opens window)It's about the principle. No one tells Stan Pines he's out of the game. No one tells- whoa!(Falls out window)
Soos and the Real Girl,Wendy,I'll get your orthopedic back pillow.
Soos and the Real Girl,Stan,(Off-screen)Thank you.
Soos and the Real Girl,Narration,Cut to Gravity Malls
Soos and the Real Girl,Mabel,"You can do this, Soos!(Dipper gives him water)Just remember what your love crew taught you. How does she look?"
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,Nice!
Soos and the Real Girl,Mabel,What are her stories?
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,Interesting!
Soos and the Real Girl,Mabel,And who's gonna pay for dinner?
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,SOOS IS!
Soos and the Real Girl,Dipper,"Now, DATE!(Blows air horn)"

Soos and the Real Girl,Mabel,They grow up so fast.
Soos and the Real Girl,Narration,Cut to Hoo Ha Owl's entrance.
Soos and the Real Girl,Melody,"(Rubbing her leg with the other)Itchy legs, itchy legs-- Oh, hi Soos!"
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,Melody! Are you ready for a(Looks at hand)date with(Looks at other hand)me?

Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,(Spits out water onto Melody and coughs)
Soos and the Real Girl,Melody,"Soos, are you okay?"
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,"No! I'm, uh, fine! Everything's fine."
Soos and the Real Girl,Melody,You sure? You're spitting an awful lot.
Soos and the Real Girl,.GIFfany,"(On three screens makes subtitles appear reading, ""You left me for her?"" followed by an ex-ed out image of Melody's face)"
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,"(Sweating)Uh, can you sit tight? I have to go to the bathroom for a long time. Not in a weird way.(Runs off too Dipper and Mabel, who are hiding behind a pizza box)"
Soos and the Real Girl,Mabel,"Soos, what are you doing out there?"
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,"I got a big problem, guys. I'm being stalked by .GIFfany!"
Soos and the Real Girl,Dipper and Mabel,.GIFfany?
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,"Or maybe it's pronouced, ""Jiffany?"" I was never really sure."
Soos and the Real Girl,Dipper,"Soos, get a grip on yourself. .GIFfany can't stalk you because she's not real!"
Soos and the Real Girl,Narration,".GIFfany has a very close close-up on the three screens. From the screen's inside, it shows that Soos is the target, and Dipper and Mabel are the little enemies."
Soos and the Real Girl,Mabel,Uh-oh.
Soos and the Real Girl,Dipper,"Take it fromsomeone who brought an arcade game to life, this will not end well."
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,Don't worry. I'm pretty sure she's stuck on TV screens.
Soos and the Real Girl,Narration,".GIFfany is seen traveling across game screens and stops at ""Fight Fighters."""
Soos and the Real Girl,Rumble McSkirmish,"Ha! A new challenger approaches! Prepare to be- dah!!!(Gets shocked by .GIFfany, whose lightning reaches the stage)"
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,"Oh, boy.(Runs up to Melody)So hey, anyway, you uh, wanna move this date into the forest far away from all electronics and people?"
Soos and the Real Girl,Melody,What? But the floor show's about to start.
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,Uh!
Soos and the Real Girl,Narration,The four mascots of Hoo Ha Owl's are shown playing instruments. Two rats in barrels are also on the sides.
Soos and the Real Girl,Big Beaver,(Chuckles)
Soos and the Real Girl,Hoo-Ha,Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Who wants to hear Hoo Ha the Owl? Oh! Who...?(Shuts down)
Soos and the Real Girl,Narration,"Lights center on the beaver cheerleader, who is possessed by .GIFfany."
Soos and the Real Girl,.GIFfany,"Hello, friends. Hoo Ha the owl is dead.(Lights go out. Cowboy frog plays quietly)This next song goes out to my forever boyfriend, Soos."
Soos and the Real Girl,Melody,"Soos, what's going on?"
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,No time to explain! We gotta get out of here!(Drags Melody to the door. Dipper and Mabel run with them)
Soos and the Real Girl,.GIFfany,"The only way out, Soos, is in my arms!(Eyes turn red. Snaps fingers, and takes possession of the other animatronics; To animatronics:)After them!"
Soos and the Real Girl,Narration,"People run out of the restaurant, screaming."

Soos and the Real Girl,Stan,(Screams)
Soos and the Real Girl,Narration,"Cut back to restaurant, where everyone continues to run out except for Dipper, Mabel, Soos, and Melody, because the door slams shut before they can leave with everyone else."
Soos and the Real Girl,.GIFfany,"Sorry, Soos, but you can't run away from our relationship!(Takes control of skee-ball games, making them shoot out balls)"
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,"(Pulls down an arcade game for cover)So, about all this, I may have purchased a dating simulator that obtained sentience and went crazy."
Soos and the Real Girl,.GIFfany,"Oh, I am crazy. Crazy for you, Soos.(Shoots lightning at the gang)"
Soos and the Real Girl,Melody,(Hair catches fire and she starts screaming as the small flame burns)
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,"(Quickly pats fire out)Oh no! I'm so sorry, Melody! I'll fix this. It's me that she wants. I'll distract her while Dipper and Mabel keep you safe! It's the only way!"
Soos and the Real Girl,Melody,"Soos, these are children."
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,"The only WAYYYY!(Runs towards the kitchen, still being attacked by the skee-ball machines)Over here, .GIFfany!"
Soos and the Real Girl,.GIFfany,Stop!
Soos and the Real Girl,Narration,Soos uses a serving plate top slide under the attacking animatronics and under the flip-open kitchen door. .GIFfany uses her lightning to open the door.
Soos and the Real Girl,Dipper,"On three we split. One, two--"

Soos and the Real Girl,Big Beaver,I'm gonna eat your face like pizza!
Soos and the Real Girl,Narration,"Dipper screams and ducks. Big beaver hits a win button and recieves a lot of tickets. He claps. Melody then knocks him out with a chair, but is attacked by more animatronics. She screams."
Soos and the Real Girl,.GIFfany,"(Surrounding Soos)I've got you surrounded, Soos. There's no way out!"
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,"Please, let my friends go, I'll do anything you want, I promise!"
Soos and the Real Girl,.GIFfany,"I seem to remember someone promising to be my boyfriend. Think about it.(Shows on TV screen, and pictures of girls flow behind her)Real girls are unpredictable. They judge you."
Soos and the Real Girl,Girls,(Laugh)
Soos and the Real Girl,.GIFfany,"Do you really think that Melody will take you back after this awful date?(Screen shows Melody angrily giving Soos back his flowers to her and slams the door. It starts to rain. Cut back to .GIFfany)I can download your brain into the game, with me, and we'll be together,forever.(Points her at Soos, and it turns into an extending flash drive)"
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,(Cover belly button with his vest)Ah! Stay back!(Throws a candy bar and a screwdriver)
Soos and the Real Girl,.GIFfany,"Come on, Soos. Don't make me delete you, too."
Soos and the Real Girl,Narration,"Soos pulls out the ""Romance Academy 7"" disc from his pocket."
Soos and the Real Girl,.GIFfany,What do you say?
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,"I say, game over, .GIFfany!(Opens oven)"
Soos and the Real Girl,.GIFfany,No! Wait!
Soos and the Real Girl,Narration,"Soos throws the disc in the oven. It distorts and crinkles, .GIFfany screams and is erased from existence. The face of the specific animatronic she possessed melts, and the animatronic shuts down. The other animatronics shut down as well causing Dipper, Mabel and Melody to fall into the ball pit."
Soos and the Real Girl,Narration,"Cut outside, where Will E. Badger also shuts down and falls to the ground. Stan picks up Goldie."
Soos and the Real Girl,Stan,You did it! You old beautiful monster. You did it!(Hugs Goldie)How's about you and me hit the town? These old-has-beens are goin' to Vegas!
Soos and the Real Girl,Narration,Cut to the wrecked Hoo-Ha's place. Soos and Melody sit upon the destruction.
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,(Sighs)I'm sorry for all this. I honestly remember this place being a lot more fun when I was a kid.
Soos and the Real Girl,Melody,"Believe it or not, but I've been on worse dates."
Soos and the Real Girl,Soos,Really?
Soos and the Real Girl,Melody,Never date a magician.

Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Mabel,"Uh, Waddles! Don't you want to stay up here and record some morning pranks with me?"
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Dipper,"Mabel, this pig's got a gift. He needs to share it with the world!"
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Waddles,"I'm sorry, Mabel. There is more to life than making fart noises, and laughing at those fart noises. I see that now.(He and Dipper leave)"

Top story today: coping with crippling loneliness after losing my co-host.(Presses button, which plays a recording of an electric guitar riff and a man saying ""Loneliness!"". Holds up a picture of ""Waddles' birthday, probably???"")What did that nasty goop do to you? You're not happier like this, are you?"
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Dipper,(Fastening a bolt on a big machine)This is your greatest invention yet! It could solve every problem of mankind!

Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Waddles,"(He makes a mechanical hand pet her)I'm still your friend, Mabel, but I'm helping people now."
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Mabel,But what about helping me? Do you really want to spend your whole life in meetings with dumb smart guys? This brain junk has made you forget who you are. Don't you remember... us?
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Waddles,"(Flashes back on various memories of hanging out with Mabel)It all makes sense now. What good is helping the world if I can't help my favorite person in the world? It's a good thing I built in a dumb-dumb switch.(Pulls a lever from ""FWD."" to ""REV"")"
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Dipper,"Waddles, Waddles, don't! WAIT!"
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Waddles,"I'm sorry, Dipper. In my last eight seconds of consciousness I want you to know that science is a horizon to search for, not a prize to hold in your hand. Also, I miss getting my tummy tickled.(Squeals; jumps into Mabel's arms)"

Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Dipper,Good pig. Uggh.
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Narration,Cut back to Stan in the Mystery Shack.
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Stan,"You know what, you're right. Don't buy the pig. In fact, I'm probably better off leaving him with my niece."
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Narration,An arrow with a suction cup on the end sticks to his fez.
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Stan,"No shooting in the house, sweetie! But perhaps I can interest you in something else.(Walks back over to the chest and pulls out a tape)Like these spooooky moooovies.

Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Mabel and Shimmery Twinkleheart,...because you believed in yourself.
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Stan and Soos,Boo!/Uhhh...
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Dipper,Everything about this is bad.
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Stan,"Well, that just put me 90 minutes closer to death.(Holds up movie)It's time you kids learned to watch the classics from my day."
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Mabel,"Ooo, old people movies. Get ready for references we don't understand, and words we can't repeat."

Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Dipper,Oh no. Mabel!
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Stan,Well. Your sister's broken.
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Dipper,"Oh, Grunkle Stan, I should have told you before. Mabel has a childhood terror of old-timey stop-motion animation. It's like her number one fear since we were kids."
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Stan,"Heh heh. Come on, those hogey old things? How scared could she be?"
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Narration,Cut to Mabel hiding in the laundry basket in the attic.
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Mabel,The cyclops! His face is made of nightmares!
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Stan,"(Opens the closet door)Kid, it's just a movie, it can't hurt you!"
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Mabel,No talking. They wait for you to talk and then crawl inside your mouth!
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Dipper,Why did you have to show her that tape?
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Stan,There's got to be a way to get her over this!(Looks at the back of the tape)Huh...
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Narration,Cut to everyone at the gates ofHarry Claymore'sworkplace. Mabel is still in the laundry basket.
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Stan,"Alright. If we can just get the director to show her the models are fake, maybe she'll finally calm down."
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Soos Ramirez,"I don't know, dude. According to the Internet, special effects genius Harry Claymore is some kind of recluse."
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Stan,"The man wants his privacy. I can respect that.(Swings rope over gate)Well, everyone over the fence."
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Narration,"Everyone is in the yard, heading to the house."
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Stan,"You see, Mabel, those monsters are just clay models moved around one frame at a time, by an antisocial shut-in."
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Soos,Those people are called animators.
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Dipper,Hello? Mr. Claymore?
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Stan,We wanna get a look at your figurines!
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Soos,We're not paparazzi!(Flashes camera phone several times)
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Dipper,"Aha!(Picks up a mini gorilla figurine)See, Mabel? It's all just special effects. You can come out."
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Mabel,NO.
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Stan,"Kid, listen to me. For the last time, there is nothing here to be afraid--"
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Narration,Clay cyclops walks up behind Stan
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Cyclops,(Roars)

Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Stan,"(Drops the basket with Mabel in it and backs away, as cyclops swipes at them)It's slowly(Swipe)swiping at us!(Swipe)"
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Soos,Let's escape by standing still!(Is picked up by cyclops)It didn't work!
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Narration,The cyclops grabs Stan and skeletons pop out of the ground.
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Dipper,"(Screams; runs off. He trips over Mabel's basket, which throws her out.)"
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Skeleton,(Grabs Mabel's head)
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Mabel,Ahh!(runs and trips in front of the stairs. Gets back up and runs up the stairs)
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Dipper,(Being stuck in clay along with Stan and Soos)Ah! How is this happening? What dotheywant?
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Harry Claymore,I'm afraid they want you.(He is also tied up)
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Stan,Harry Claymore! Master of special effects! Circa-1970's-something.
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Harry Claymore,"Alas, my effects are more special than you know."
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Dipper,What? But how are these things real? What about stop motion?
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Harry,"What? You really believe someone moves these figures one frame at a time? I'm not a masochist! I use black magic to make them animate themselves. It was great at first, but one day..."
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Narration,Flashback
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Cyclops,"(Looks at newspaper, which says that computer animation is better than stop motion)No! Where's the heart?"
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Harry,"Now that they were out of work, they went mad and enslaved me! And now they will turn you into unholy beasts clay to join in their mischeif!"
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Soos,"Huh, Mr. Pines. At least you finally get to work with your favorite director. And by work, I mean suffocate inside a big wad of clay!"
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Narration,More clay is stuffed on Soos. The three call out for help. Mabel sees the whole thing.
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Mabel,"Oh, what do I do? How can I defeat those monstrosities?(Picks up a wad of clay with two holes in them. Mabel adds a line so it looks like a smiley face)Hey. I changed into something I like. Woah. I think I have an idea!(Runs down stairs.)Hey, One-Eyeclopses! Yeah, I'm talking to you, dumb-dumb! Come at me! WOOAAAAA!!!(Runs at it with her arms in front of her and jumps into its stomach, crawls up it, and emerges from its shoulders)Wipe that face off your face!(Smears it)Oh, I've got big plans for you.(Later)Hey, skeleton dorks! IT'S CLAYBACK TIME!!"
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Narration,The Cyclops is remade into Shimmery Twinkleheart.
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Shimmery Twinkleheart,(Walks up and falls down on a bunch of skeletons)
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Soos,"Dude, you conquered your fear!"
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Shimmery Twinkleheart,That's right. Because she believed in herself-
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Mabel,"JAM, IT, TWINKLEHEART! Just start pounding those skeletons!"
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Shimmery Twinkleheart,Hoo hoo hoo...(Attacking skeletons)
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Mabel,(Runs to everyone else)
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Dipper,"Mabel, you did it! So you're not scared anymore?"
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Mabel,"(Taking the clay off of him)Oh, I'm scared twice as much now. But now I know it's rational!(Starts taking the clay off of Stan)"
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Stan,"Kid, I'm sorry I doubted you.(Punches through clay). You were right! Stop-motion is pure evil."
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Narration,We see the stop-motion monsters fighting in shadow. Shimmery Twinkleheart punches several skeletons.
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Soos,And probably really expensive.

Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Soos,"This is an impressive fight, though. I'm glad I'm facing towards it."
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Narration,A scorpion with the head of medusa attacks Shimmery Twinkleheart and they melt into the mass of clay. Unicorns rain from the ceiling and fall into it.

Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Narration,"Cut back to the Mystery Shack. Stan, Dipper, and Mabel are watching ""Loiclothiclese in the creature with an unreasonable amount of heads."""
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Dipper,"Well, I think today we learned that you can remold your fears."

Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Soos,"Holy Toledo!(He steps out of a wall of clay and looks likeGumby)Who wants to see me change into most anything?

Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Traveler,"(Drinks it, then stumbles around and collapses)"
Little Gift Shop of Horrors,Stan,"You should have bought my merch when you had the chance, buddy. But that's okay. I'll have something new for sale very soon.(Painting the person with glue)Heh heh heh heh..."

Society of the Blind Eye,Narration,Open to a shot ofGreasy's Diner.Lazy Susanis locking up the diner for the night.
Society of the Blind Eye,Lazy Susan,"(hums while sweeping a broom across the floor)Ta dum, locking up.(peers at possums scurrying around in the dishes, pokes the possums with her broom)Shoo, possums, shoo!(She walks near a table)Git,McGucket, git!(pokes him with a broom, making him run out from underneath the table on all fours, panting, and mumbling incoherently.)Ta dum, ta dum...(locks the door)Good night, diner. Good night, trees.(She passes by thegnomesstanding on top of each other, attempting to steal a pie.)Good night, tiny men stealing my pie. Wait, WHAT?!(Lifts her eyelid)"
Society of the Blind Eye,Jeff,"Lift with your knees. No, yourknees. If I go one more hour without eating, I'm gonna resort to cannibalism.(notices Lazy Susan, and tips his hat.)Ma'am."
Society of the Blind Eye,Lazy Susan,"(Shrieks)Little magic men! What does it mean? What do I do?(bumps into a payphone and dials 911)Yes, hi. I'd like to report something. I'm at Greasy's Diner. You won't believe what I've witnessed.(Cut to two figures sneaking up behind her, from a patch of nearby bushes)It's unbelievable! It's indescribable! It's- AAAAAAAH!!(The figures sneak up behind her and kidnap her, dragging her away.)"
Society of the Blind Eye,Blind Ivan,It is unseen.(TheBlind Eyesymbol is graffitied on the wall)
Society of the Blind Eye,Jeff,"Welp, back to pie.(The gnomes grab the pie and run off. A gnome accidentally drops a slice.)I wasthisclose to eating you,Steve."
Society of the Blind Eye,Narration,"Cut totheme song. Cut toDipperandMabel'sbedroom. Dipper is examining a poster board on his wall entitled ""Who isThe Author?"
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper Pines,"Alright author, who are you? Who are you?...(chews on a pen, which accidentally breaks getting ink in his mouth)Blech! Not again.(tosses it into a bin full of broken pens.)"
Society of the Blind Eye,Mabel Pines,"(runs in with a bottle)Hey, bro-bro. Look what I got!"
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,"(sarcastically)Yay, a filthy green bottle!"
Society of the Blind Eye,Mabel,"It's a bottle message fromMermando, remember? He was part fish, part shirtless guy.(gasps)What if he wants to get back together?"
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,"I wouldn't get your hopes up, Mabel."
Society of the Blind Eye,Mabel,"Too late! Hopes are way way up!(squeals excitedly, opens bottle cap and reads letter)""Dear Mabel..."" So far so good! ""It is with a heavy heart..."" So far so good! ""...that I must inform you, I'm getting married""?!"
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,Andthere it is.
Society of the Blind Eye,Mabel,"(reading)""In order to prevent an undersea civil war... arranged wedding...Queen of the Manatees?!""(looking at picture)And she's so beautiful!(sighs)This can't be happening!"
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,"Oh, Mabel. You'll get over him eventually."
Society of the Blind Eye,Mabel,"You don't understand, Dipper.(Pulls out her scrapbook.)On my first day here, I made this page for summer romances. Look at my luck.(Points to picture ofNorman)Turned out to be gnomes,(Points to picture ofGideon)child psycho,(Points to a picture ofGabe Benson)made out with his own hands. And now...(writes ""FAILED"" at the top of the page)I wish I could just forget about them forever."
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,"Hey, if it's any consolation, my summer mission isn't a huge success either. I'm still trying to find the author ofthis journal, but with his laptop smashed, I've lost any lead in finding him."
Society of the Blind Eye,Mabel,"(Looks at thelaptop)Wait a minute. Dipper, look!"
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,Through your bottle?
Society of the Blind Eye,Mabel,Just do it.
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,"(Peers through the bottle, and notices a logo entitled ""McGucket Labs"" magnified on the back of the laptop)""McGucket Labs."" Wait, Old Man McGucket?"
Society of the Blind Eye,Mabel,"Dipper, you don't think?..."
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,"It couldn't be... It doesn't make any sense, unless...(He starts connecting pictures related to McGucket)This matches with this... This goes over here... And then the name... So then, that would mean... Old Man McGucket wrote the journal?!"
Society of the Blind Eye,Narration,Cut toMystery ShackGift Shop.
Society of the Blind Eye,Boombox,"Am I blanchin',Girl we blanchin',I live up in a mansionAm I blanchin',Girl we blanchinI live up in a mansion"
Society of the Blind Eye,Soos Ramirez,"(sings along, while sweeping broom across floor)Am I blanchin',Girl we blanchin',I live up in a mansion"
Society of the Blind Eye,Wendy Corduroy,(annoyed)Ugh! I can't get that terrible song out of my head.
Society of the Blind Eye,Soos,"Oh, you mean ""Straight Blanchin'"" by 'Lil Big Dawg? It's the catchiest song of the summer."
Society of the Blind Eye,Wendy,"What is ""blanchin""? Rappers can't just make up words!"
Society of the Blind Eye,Soos,"Rappers are visionaries, Wendy. If they told me to eat my own pants, I would do it."
Society of the Blind Eye,Boombox,"Eat your own pants, eat your own pants, yeah!"
Society of the Blind Eye,Soos,"I guess I have no choice.(unzips pants, and hums)Doot-do-do..."
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper and Mabel,(run inside)
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,"Wendy, Soos, we need to go see Old Man McGucket!"
Society of the Blind Eye,Mabel,We'll explain on the way!(everyone runs outside)
Society of the Blind Eye,Stan Pines,"Hey, what about work? Kids!! ...why is Soos eating his own pants?"
Society of the Blind Eye,Narration,Cut to thejunkyard. The group is searching for McGucket.
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,"Old Man McGucket, are you here?"
Society of the Blind Eye,Soos,Here hillbilly-billy-billy-billy.
Society of the Blind Eye,Nate,"(standing in front of graffiti that says ""McSuckIt"", laughing)That's good."
Society of the Blind Eye,Lee,"Took an hour to think of this, but it was worth it. Ha!(They see McGucket coming out and chases them away as Nate and Lee laugh and run away)"
Society of the Blind Eye,Old Man McGucket,"Get outta here, you salt lickin', hornswagglin!... McSuckit, they got me good.(Sees the group.)Visitors! Come, come.(He leads them inside.)Pull up some rusty metal. You're just in time for my hourly turf war with the hillbilly what lives in my mirror.(He yells at his reflection in a bathtub.)Quit starin' at me when I bathe!"
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,"You can drop the act, McGucket. I know you're the author. You studied the mysteries of thistownand wrote this book.(holds up Journal 3)"
Society of the Blind Eye,Wendy,"Dude, you're the genius Dipper's been searching for all summer!"
Society of the Blind Eye,McGucket,"Uh, genius? I'm no genius. I've never done nothin' worthwhile in my life. Everyone knows I'm no good to nobody. I can't remember what I used to be, but I must've been a big failure to end up like this."
Society of the Blind Eye,Soos,But the laptop has your name on it.
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,"What about this book? Are you sure you didn't write it? Here, look closely.(He flips through the journal.)"
Society of the Blind Eye,McGucket,"I told you, I don't recall. Everything before 1982 is just a blur. Just a hazy...(The journal flips forward to an image of the Blind Eye, the symbol of the society appear in his irises. He shrieks)The Blind Eye! Robes, the men, my mind! They did something!"
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,Who did?
Society of the Blind Eye,McGucket,"I... oh, I don't recall."
Society of the Blind Eye,Mabel,"Oh, you poor old man! No wonder your mind's all..(blows raspberry)You've been through something intense."
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,"What if McGucket learned something he wasn't supposed to know, and someone, or something, messed with his mind? We've got to get to the bottom of this."
Society of the Blind Eye,Wendy,"Think, dude. What is the earliest thing you can remember?"
Society of the Blind Eye,McGucket,"Uh, this is, I think.(He pulls down a newspaper article.)"
Society of the Blind Eye,Wendy,Thehistory museum!
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,Then that's where we're going.
Society of the Blind Eye,Narration,"Cut to the group in acar. ""Straight Blanchin"" is playing."
Society of the Blind Eye,Wendy,"Ugh, Soos!(Takes out the CD and tosses it out of the car window, then awkwardly pauses realizing that wasn't cool, Soos is sad then mad)I'll buy you a new one."
Society of the Blind Eye,Narration,Cut to the History Museum. Everyone enters through the windows.
Society of the Blind Eye,Soos,Hello? Anyone here?
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,"All right, keep your eyes peeled for anything suspicious."
Society of the Blind Eye,Mabel,(sighs)
Society of the Blind Eye,Wendy,"Mabel, are you okay? You just walked by a cat without petting it."
Society of the Blind Eye,Mabel,"Oh Wendy, everything I look at reminds me of my failed romances. That formaldehyde heart. That romantic diorama. Even this poster of my most recent ex-crush.(She pulls down a poster of Gabe, revealing a poster ofSev'ral Timez,moreof her ex-crushes.)Aw, come on!"
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,(To McGucket:)So your last memory was here. Anything coming back?
Society of the Blind Eye,Soos,"Guys, look!(Down the hall, a shadowy figure runs away.)"
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,"Hey, who's there?(They run into a room filled with depictions of eyes.)"
Society of the Blind Eye,McGucket,Well kettle my corn. He vanish-ified.
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,It doesn't make sense. Where did he go?
Society of the Blind Eye,McGucket,I feel like all these eyeballs are a-watchin' me.
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,Wait... they are! Move aside.
Society of the Blind Eye,McGucket,"(Moves aside, revealing a central eye)"
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,(Pushes it and a staircase forms behind the fireplace)A secret passageway.
Society of the Blind Eye,McGucket,We'll have to be stealthy. I'll hambone a message if there's trouble.(Slaps his arms and legs. Translation:)Coyotes are coming for our sweetbreads.
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,I have no idea what that means.
Society of the Blind Eye,Everyone,(Goes down the staircase)
Society of the Blind Eye,Society of the Blind Eye,"(chanting:)""Novus ordo seclorum"" (which is Latin for ""New order of the ages"")"
Society of the Blind Eye,Blind Ivan,Who is the subject of our meeting?
Society of the Blind Eye,Society member,"(Lazy Susan is pulled out, blindfolded.)This woman."
Society of the Blind Eye,Mabel,Lazy Susan?
Society of the Blind Eye,Blind Ivan,What is it that you have seen?
Society of the Blind Eye,All members,Speak!
Society of the Blind Eye,Lazy Susan,"Uh, well, uh, I was leaving the diner, and I saw these little bearded doodads, and I was, like, ""Bwaaa?"""
Society of the Blind Eye,Blind Ivan,"There, there.(Pullsray gunout of the box. The members pull down their hoods.)You won't be like ""Bwaaa?"" for much longer."
Society of the Blind Eye,Lazy Susan,What is that gizmo? It looks like a hair dryer. Are you guys barbers?(The Lead Member zaps her with the gun.) AAAAAH!
Society of the Blind Eye,Blind Ivan,"Lazy Susan, what do you know of little bearded men?"
Society of the Blind Eye,Lazy Susan,"My mind is cleared, thanks to the Society of the Blind Eye."
Society of the Blind Eye,Society,It is unseen!
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,Oh my gosh. They erased Lazy Susan's memory.
Society of the Blind Eye,McGucket,"(hamboning:)Oh, *&#*%!"
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,"Guys, are you seeing this? They just wiped Lazy Susan's memory!"
Society of the Blind Eye,Soos,They should've wiped off that awful mascara.(Chuckles)
Society of the Blind Eye,Mabel,"(Angrily)I think she looks beautiful, Soos!"
Society of the Blind Eye,Wendy,"(Just as angry)She's doing the best she can, Soos!"
Society of the Blind Eye,Soos,Whoa! Touched a nerve there.
Society of the Blind Eye,Blind Ivan,"Lazy Susan, how do you feel?"
Society of the Blind Eye,Lazy Susan,"(Being led away)I feel great! I can't even remember what was wrong, or what I'm doing here, or if I'm a man or a woman!"
Society of the Blind Eye,Blind Ivan,"Your memories will be safe with us, buried in the Hall of the Forgotten.(Removes a tube from the memory erasing gun, and writes on it:)(Lazy) Susan Wentworth"
Society of the Blind Eye,Society,"(chanting:)Into the Hall of the Forgotten. Into the Hall of the Forgotten.(talking and dispersing)Good chanting, boys. Have you been practicing?"
Society of the Blind Eye,Blind Ivan,Meeting adjourned.
Society of the Blind Eye,Society member 1,Unsee you later.
Society of the Blind Eye,Society member 2,Unsee you later!
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,"Amazing. A secret society of evil mind erasers. I'll bet they erased your memory a long time ago. If we could find where your memories have been hidden, it could be the key to unlocking all the mysteries of Gravity Falls. All right, Mabel, Wendy, you two stay here and make sure those robe guys don't come back."
Society of the Blind Eye,Wendy,Whoo!(rubs Mabel's hair)Girl's club.
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,"Soos, you, me, and McGucket are gonna go find the Hall of the Forgotten."
Society of the Blind Eye,Narration,Soos' hat is sucked into pipe
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,Follow that hat!
Society of the Blind Eye,Society member,Halt! Is someone there?
Society of the Blind Eye,McGucket,Aah! What do we do? Where do we go?
Society of the Blind Eye,Narration,Cut to them disguised as a diorama.
Society of the Blind Eye,Society member 1,"Man, these are really poorly made."
Society of the Blind Eye,Society member 2,I could've sworn I heard someone.
Society of the Blind Eye,Society member 1,Probably just the janitor kissing that wax settler woman again.
Society of the Blind Eye,Society member 2,Whoof! Remind me to erase that from my memory.(They leave)
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,Whew!(Sees the hat)There it is. Hurry!
Society of the Blind Eye,McGucket,"Honey fogelin', saltlickin' skullduggery."
Society of the Blind Eye,Soos,"Man, you have got to teach me some of those old-man swear words."
Society of the Blind Eye,Narration,Cut to Mabel and Wendy in the main chamber
Society of the Blind Eye,Mabel,"(sighs, wearing Wendy's hat)I just don't get it, Wendy. I hug a lot, I can burp the alphabet, I have scratch and sniff clothing. Why does every boy leave me?"
Society of the Blind Eye,Wendy,"Pfft, who cares? Boys are the worst. You shouldn't get hung up, man."
Society of the Blind Eye,Mabel,"Maybe I come on too strong, you know?"
Society of the Blind Eye,Wendy,"Well, what's your opener? Pretend I'm a boy.(She puts up her hair, giving herself a mustache.)(in a manly voice)Mmm, testosterone.(spits)"
Society of the Blind Eye,Mabel,(loudly)HI! I'M MABEL! I'M TWELVE AND OWN APIG! WANT TO GET MARRIED?!
Society of the Blind Eye,Wendy,"(laughs)Honestly, that was perfect.(lets back down her hair)You should just forget about guys, man."
Society of the Blind Eye,Mabel,"Wendy, that's it. Forget about guys!(She picks up the memory gun)I just need to type ""summer romances"" into this thing, and I won't feel bad about them anymore."
Society of the Blind Eye,Wendy,"Whoa, hold up, Mabel. We don't even know what that thing does. You could accidentally erase, like, learning to read, or breathe, or..."
Society of the Blind Eye,Mabel,Or one of those terrible summer songs you can't get out of your head?(Wendy realizes shemayhave a point.)
Society of the Blind Eye,Narration,Cut to the boys in the Hall of the Forgotten.Memory tubesare stacked to the ceiling.
Society of the Blind Eye,Soos,"Whoa, look at all these tubes. People must've been getting their memories erased all over town."
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,"Whoa, look at this.(Holds up a tube titled ""Robbie V.Memories"")"
Society of the Blind Eye,Narration,Soos inserts the tube into a viewing machine.
Society of the Blind Eye,Blind Ivan,"(off screen)Yes, Robbie, what is it that you have seen?"
Society of the Blind Eye,Robbie Valentino,"(on screen)So I was attacked by thismagic kung fu guythat was throwing, like, balls of fire at me. I kicked his butt though."
Society of the Blind Eye,Blind Ivan,"(not buying it)Robbie, speak honestly."
Society of the Blind Eye,Robbie,(begrudgingly)I was saved by a 12-year-old.
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,Why are they erasing peoples' memories? I still don't get it.
Society of the Blind Eye,McGucket,"Looky, fellers.(He points to a tube labelled ""McGucket Memories"")It's those words what people call me."
Society of the Blind Eye,Soos,"Oh, dude, your memories. We did it!"
Society of the Blind Eye,McGucket,"Grabby, grabby.(He takes the tube, which sets off an alarm.)I got it!"
Society of the Blind Eye,Narration,Cut back to the girls.
Society of the Blind Eye,Wendy,"I don't know, Mabel. Are you really sure this is a good idea?"
Society of the Blind Eye,Mabel,Allideas are good ideas!(Alarm goes off just before she could shoot.)
Society of the Blind Eye,Wendy,Do you hear that?
Society of the Blind Eye,Narration,Cut to the males
Society of the Blind Eye,McGucket,The alarm in my brain is a-ringin' again. Ah!
Society of the Blind Eye,Society member,Halt! Who's there?
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,Oh no!
Society of the Blind Eye,Soos,Run!
Society of the Blind Eye,Society member,Get back here!(Chases Dipper and Soos. McGucket hides.)
Society of the Blind Eye,McGucket,"Oh, you've really tarred it up now, Fiddleford. This is all your fault.(Pause)Why does my beard have a bandage? Does that even make sense? Why has no one pointed that out?"
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,"Okay, I think we're safe.(Hands reach out from the shadows and cover Dipper and Soos's eyes.)"
Society of the Blind Eye,Soos,"We playing ""Guess Who""? Dude, I know it's you, Dipper. Such big... strong hands....(Everyone, including Mabel and Wendy, is tied to a pole)"
Society of the Blind Eye,Blind Ivan,You shouldn't have come here. We do not give up our secrets lightly.
Society of the Blind Eye,Wendy,Who are you bathrobe-wearing freaks?
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,Why are you doing this?
Society of the Blind Eye,Mabel,What's with your creepy British accent?
Society of the Blind Eye,Blind Ivan,"Well, I suppose we are going to erase your minds anyway.(One by one, the Society members unmask)"
Society of the Blind Eye,Mabel,Toby Determined?
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,Bud Gleeful?
Society of the Blind Eye,Wendy,Thatfarmer guy?(The member behind him isTats)
Society of the Blind Eye,Soos,"Creepydude who married a woodpecker? You too? How's that marriage goin, by the way?"
Society of the Blind Eye,Woodpecker guy,"Oh, great, great.(whispering:)Not great."
Society of the Blind Eye,Blind Ivan,"And you've never metmebefore. And if you had, you wouldn't remember.(He removes his hood, revealing a bald tattooed head and a red scar through one eye)I am Blind Ivan, and we are the Society of the Blind Eye.(Theother membersdo a gesture by moving their arms away from their faces)Formed many years ago by our founder... our founder... Does anyone remember who he was?"
Society of the Blind Eye,Bud Gleeful,We've been usin' that ray on our own brains an awful lot.
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,But why would you do all this? What do you have to gain?
Society of the Blind Eye,Narration,"As Blind Ivan speaks, images appear on the screen. A man drinking coffee witnesses some octopus creature take a truck of lumber away and does a spit take. Later, he can't sleep at night. Eventually, he is in the society lair and uses the ray on himself. Three members are then seen wiping the memories of an elderly couple who witnessed a giant eyeball. In town, we see the side effects of the ray on three peoples. One is walking, one ran into a telephone pole, and one splashed a water bottle on his face, but all the same blank smiling expression."
Society of the Blind Eye,Blind Ivan,"As you have no doubt discovered, Gravity Falls is a town plagued with supernatural strangeness. No one knew how to stop the things that went bump in the night, so our founder invented the next best thing: a way for us to forget. We took it upon ourselves to help the troubled townsfolk by erasing the memories of the strange things they've seen. Now the people of Gravity Falls go about their lives ignorant and happy, thanks to us. And as a perk, we help ourselves forget things that trouble us. Everyone hassomethingthey'd rather forget. In fact, your own sister was about to use that ray on herself. Isn't that right?"
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,(surprised)Mabel? Seriously?
Society of the Blind Eye,Mabel,"(nervously ashamed)Hehe, maybe..."
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,"Don't you see? This is ruining lives! What about Old Man McGucket? He lives in a hut and talks to animals, thanks to you. Don't you feel bad about that?"
Society of the Blind Eye,Blind Ivan,"Mmm, maybe a little.(Shoots himself with the ray)But not anymore. You won't be telling anyone else what you've learned here. Say good-bye to your summer.(He aims the ray gun at them)"
Society of the Blind Eye,Soos,"Guys, if we're gonna forget everything, I got some stuff I wanna get off my chest. Mabel, for half the summer, I thought your name was Maple, like the syrup. No one corrected me!"
Society of the Blind Eye,Mabel,"I only lovesomeof my stuffed animals, and the guilt is killing me!"
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,"Sometimes I use big words, and I don't actually know what they mean. I mean, I'm supposed to be the smart guy. If I'm not the smart guy, who am I?"
Society of the Blind Eye,Wendy,"Okay, I'm not actually laid back. I'm stressed, like, 24/7. Have youmetmy family?"
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,I'm going to miss you guys.
Society of the Blind Eye,Soos,(Talking over everyone else.)... Maple.
Society of the Blind Eye,Blind Ivan,"(The other members cover their faces with their hoods.)Oh, stop being a bunch of babies.(A mining pan comes flying out of nowhere like a frisbee and knocks the gun out of Ivan's hand.)Owie!(McGucket comes running past him, surprising the other members.)"
Society of the Blind Eye,All who are tied up,McGucket!
Society of the Blind Eye,McGucket,"(Frees them with an axe.)I raided the mining display for weapons. Now fight like a hillbilly, fellers!"
Society of the Blind Eye,Narration,"Everyone grabs a weapon: banjos, stuffed raccoons etc. Soos grabs an informational display about dysentery."
Society of the Blind Eye,Soos,"Oh, nobody better miss!"
Society of the Blind Eye,Blind Ivan,They know too much. Don't let them escape!
Society of the Blind Eye,Wendy,"(attacking society members, including Woodpecker guy)Get this song outta your head!"
Society of the Blind Eye,Soos,"Dysentery's gonna get you, dawg!(a member runs away scared)"
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,McGucket's memory tube.
Society of the Blind Eye,Tats,"Oh no, you don't!"
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,"(puts the memory tube into a transport tube. It zooms around the room.)Mabel, catch!"
Society of the Blind Eye,Sprott,"I'll take that, thank you. Give it up, boy. You're no match for the unstoppable power of-(His robe is caught in the tube and rips off, leaving him in his underwear.)That's right, I don't wear nothin' under my robe. Not gonna apologize for that. Maybe y'all should apologize for bein' a bunch of prudes."
Society of the Blind Eye,All,Eew!
Society of the Blind Eye,Soos,"Well, time to erase that forever.(He holds up the gun, but Blind Ivan snatches it.)"
Society of the Blind Eye,Blind Ivan,Give me that tube.
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,Never! That memory belongs to McGucket.
Society of the Blind Eye,Blind Ivan,"The Society's secrets belong to us.(He has the group in a corner and points the ray at them.)End of the line. By tomorrow, this will all seem like a bad dream. Say goodbye to your precious memories.(He fires the gun)"
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,"NO!!(He shields his eyes, but finds McGucket has jumped in front of the group, catching the ray.)McGucket, you took a bullet for me.(As McGucket gets shot with the ray again.)Oh my gosh! Are you okay?!"
Society of the Blind Eye,McGucket,Okay as I'll ever be!(laughs)
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,What?
Society of the Blind Eye,Blind Ivan,"(He keeps shooting at McGucket, who slowly walks toward him.)Why! Isn't! This! Working?!"
Society of the Blind Eye,McGucket,"Hit me with yer best shot, baldy! But my mind's been gone for thirty-odd years! Ya can't break what's already broken!"
Society of the Blind Eye,McGucket,"Say goodnight, Sally!(He headbutts Blind Ivan. The Society members are tied up)"
Society of the Blind Eye,Blind Ivan,Unhand us!
Society of the Blind Eye,Mabel,"It isn't so fun being tied up, is it? Hey, wanna draw on their faces?"
Society of the Blind Eye,Blind Ivan,What?
Society of the Blind Eye,Mabel,"Tra-la-la...(She crosses out Ivan's ""knowledge"" tattoo and replaces it with ""butts"".)"
Society of the Blind Eye,Blind Ivan,"Hey, stop that! That's not funny."
Society of the Blind Eye,Dipper,It's pretty funny.
Society of the Blind Eye,Soos,"It's, like, objectively funny."

He has been cataloging his findings about Gravity Falls in a series ofjournals. I helped him build a machine which he believed had the potential to benefit all mankind, but something went wrong. I decided to quit the project. But I lie awake at night, haunted by the thoughts of what I've done. I believe I have invented a machine that can permanently erase these memories from my mind.(He holds up the memory erasing ray.)Test Subject 1: Fiddleford.(He shoots it.

Society of the Blind Eye,Wendy,"So Mabel, do you still wanna erase those failed summer romances?"
Society of the Blind Eye,Mabel,"You know, no one likes having bad memories, but maybe it's better to remember the bad things and learn from them than to go all denial crazy trying to forget."
Society of the Blind Eye,Wendy,"That's some mature junk right there, Mabel."
Society of the Blind Eye,Mabel,"Yep. Miss Mature. That's me. Hey, you wanna help me vandalize this picture of my jerky ex-crush?(They all doodle on a picture of Gabe.)"

Blendin's Game,Mabel,"So, how much partying can fix that"
Blendin's Game,Robbie,"(Shoots Dipper in face with a water gun)Heheh, dorks. Young Robbie!"
Blendin's Game,Narration,"Cut to Soos, sitting glumly in his room"
Blendin's Game,Abuelita,"(Outside the room, to herself)Ay, Soos' father is a deadbeat! ¡Si alguna vez muestra su carota por aquí, se la voy a partir pieza por pieza!(Subtitled: ""If he ever shows his face here again, I'll tear him limb from limb!"")Ahem.(Walks into room)Soo-oo-oos. I made you cookies shaped like dinosaurs."
Blendin's Game,Soos,I don't want cookies. I wanna see Dad again.
Blendin's Game,Abuelita,"And he wants to see you, he's just... busy."
Blendin's Game,Soos,Busy in New Orleans...
Blendin's Game,Abuelita,"Aye, yes...Trust me. Youwillfeel better someday."
Blendin's Game,Mabel,"(Spying through window with Dipper)Ugh, this is awful."
Blendin's Game,Dipper,"We promised Soos a happy birthday, but how can we give him that now? This goes beyond anything we know how to fix."
Blendin's Game,Blendin,(Offscreen)Th-this way!
Blendin's Game,Dipper,Uh-oh. Hide!
Blendin's Game,Narration,"Lolph, Blendin and Dundgren walk to where Dipper and Mabel had been hiding."
Blendin's Game,Blendin,They've gotta be around here somewhere. I-I-I think I heard them!(Looks at tree)
Blendin's Game,Lolph,"Freeze!(Shoots laser gun at tree, which blows up, revealing Robbie, who runs away crying)Trace their chrono-signatures."
Blendin's Game,Blendin,"Man, the sooner I defeat those kids in Globnar, the sooner I can win my time wish."
Blendin's Game,Dundgren,Tell you what I'd do if I had a time wish. Retire early. Spend more time with the kids.
Blendin's Game,Blendin,"Naing Niang Niang Niang Niang, with the kids! Don't you know a time wish can do literally anything? Any impossible problem solved(Snaps finger)just like that? I mean, imagine the possibilities."
Blendin's Game,Dipper,"Wait, Mabel, that's it! The time wish! If we defeat Blendin in that space battle..."
Blendin's Game,Mabel,...Then we can wish that Soos' dad came to his twelfth birthday!
Blendin's Game,Dipper,And Soos' birthdays would be fixed forever.(Snaps finger)All of them.
Blendin's Game,Mabel,But do you really think we can win Globnar?
Blendin's Game,Dipper,"It's the only chance we have. Besides, it's for Soos. He would do the same for us.(Walks out from behind tree with Mabel)Here we are Blendin. We surrender."
Blendin's Game,Blendin,It's them!
Blendin's Game,Dundgren,Freeze!(Points laser gun at them)
Blendin's Game,Lolph,"(Pulling out his own gun)Careful, they're from the past. They might have powder muskets or slap bracelets."
Blendin's Game,Dipper,"Look guys, no tricks this time. We're ready to challenge you, okay?"
Blendin's Game,Blendin,Yes! Let the Globnar begin! Prepare... for... GLOBNAAA-(Blendin's voice is cut off and a green mute symbol appears in front of his mouth)
Blendin's Game,Lolph,"Hey, turns out I can mute him."
Blendin's Game,Dundgren,"Man, I wish we'd known that earlier."
Blendin's Game,Lolph,"Initializing!(Presses button wrist, and the group disappears in a flash of white, leaving a red screwdriver behind)"
Blendin's Game,Narration,"Cut to the Globnar arena. The group reappears inside. The crowd is shouting ""Globnar"" repeatedly, punching their fists in the air, and the group is shown on a large screen at the edge of the arena. A large hole opens up one one end of the arena, and the Time Baby floats up out of it."
Blendin's Game,Time Baby,Silence!(Most of the arena hushes)
Blendin's Game,Globnar Fan,Wooh! Oh yea!
Blendin's Game,Narration,The Time Baby shoots Globnar fan with laser vision.
Blendin's Game,Mabel,That is one big baby.
Blendin's Game,Time Baby,(Raising hands)Welcome Globnar tributes! I have a very important nap to get to so let's make this quick. You each have a chance to settle your time-feud through gladiatorial combat.
Blendin's Game,Robot,(Carrying a baby bottle shaped like a hourglass and filled with a universal-textured substance)You will have until Time Baby finishes drinking the cosmic sand in this hourglass.(Moves to Time Baby)
Blendin's Game,Time Baby,No!
Blendin's Game,Robot,Come on.(Pokes Time Baby with bottle)
Blendin's Game,Time Baby,Ow!
Blendin's Game,Robot,It's good for you.(Pokes Time Baby with bottle)
Blendin's Game,Time Baby,Wah!
Blendin's Game,Blendin,"Get ready, kids. When I get that time wish, you'll wish you were never born. Or rather, you'll wish you were born, because I'm gonna wish you were never born!"
Blendin's Game,Dipper,Dream on. There's two of us.
Blendin's Game,Mabel,And we have hair!
Blendin's Game,Blendin,"Oh-oh, yeah? Well I have training!(Twirls spear)What do you think I did in prison all that time?"
Blendin's Game,Mabel,Uh oh.
Blendin's Game,Time Baby,Let the Globnar... BEGIN!
Blendin's Game,Narration,"Lightning is seen and a scoreboard lights up, giving each team zero points. Blendin's, Dipper's, and Mabel's handcuffs fall off. Blendin screams and the camera pans into his mouth."
Blendin's Game,Narration,"Cut to various Globnar events: Blendin and Dipper fighting with sticks, Blendin pushes Dipper away and Mabel jumps at him, and he knocks her away as well. Blendin jumpes over the hands on the clock, but they trip Dipper and Mabel over and Blendin gets a point. ; Blendin and the twins each have futuristic cycles that can defy gravity. The twins' do a wheelie and speed up, crossing the finish line first and gaining a point. ; Cut to Dipper and Blendin playing a strange game, which is interrupted by a monster with a clock for a face. After a while of playing then two reams are tied at 244. A quick montage of images flash of other contests: Blendin chasing the kids on a giant wheel, Mabel and Blendin having a ""time dog"" eating contest, the tributes fighting in robotic cuckoo clock suits, having a wheelbarrow race, Mabel and Blendin fighting with spears on unicycles on a tightrope while Dipper swims through clocks to get away from a time shark, and the three playing a game that resembles a giant Jenga. A clock is seen and an announcer sings ""Globnar."" The tributes are seen working together and pushing the clock-faced monster through a door in the wall."
Blendin's Game,Time Baby,Very good. You have escaped theCyclocks.
Blendin's Game,Blendin,Yes! Blendin for the almost-win!
Blendin's Game,Narration,"The score is shown to be 764 to 763, Blendin."
Blendin's Game,Time Baby,"There is only one final challenge for Globnar. An ancient game, thousands of years old, chosen for its exemplification of pure strategy: The ancient art... of Laser Tag!"
Blendin's Game,Narration,A course and laser guns appear.
Blendin's Game,Time Baby,The one who touches the victory orb first will win!
Blendin's Game,Dipper,Laser tag? Seriously?
Blendin's Game,Blendin,"Oh, I know it doesn't seem that challenging now, but just wait till they turn on that fog machine. You'll be done for! You just wait until ya--"
Blendin's Game,Dipper,"(Shoots him multiple times, making the vest say ""Hit!"")"
Blendin's Game,Blendin,"Aw, man."
Blendin's Game,Dipper,"Mabel, grab the orb!"
Blendin's Game,Mabel,(Runs up to the top of the pyramid to the orb)Got it!(Touches it and everything goes white)
Blendin's Game,Time Baby,(He finishes drinking the cosmic sand)It is finished!
Blendin's Game,Robot,(Pats the Time Baby's back and he burps)
Blendin's Game,Narration,The crowd cheers and the kids' score goes up to 999.
Blendin's Game,Blendin,No! No! No! No! Nooooo!
Blendin's Game,Dipper and Mabel,(High five)Yes!
Blendin's Game,Time Baby,"You have made victory in Globnar. Before I give you your time wish, tell us; what fate do you decide for the loser?"
Blendin's Game,Blendin,"Oh, jeez..."
Blendin's Game,Mabel,Death!
Blendin's Game,Dipper,Mabel!
Blendin's Game,Mabel,Sorry. Got carried away...
Blendin's Game,Dipper,"So Blendin did try to wish us out of existence, but it was kind of our fault for ruining his life."
Blendin's Game,Mabel,"Yeah, and he's kind of too sad to be a real bad guy."
Blendin's Game,Dipper,"Maybe if we treat him right in the present, he'll turn out better in the future.(To Time Baby:)Okay. As long as you keep an eye on him, we'd like to set Blendin free, and restore his position at the Time Anomaly Correction Unit."
Blendin's Game,Mabel,And give him pretty hair!
Blendin's Game,Time Baby,So be it.
Blendin's Game,Blendin,(Handcuffs fall off)Wh-what? You'd do that for me?(Mustache-shaped hair grows on his head)I got my job back!(Places hand on Lolph's chest)I feel like hugging somebody.
Blendin's Game,Lolph,I can kill you in eight different ways.
Blendin's Game,Blendin,"(Removes hand)Yes, sir."
Blendin's Game,Time Baby,"(Rubbing face)Now, children. What is it that you want for your time wish?"
Blendin's Game,Narration,A glowing orb floats down between Dipper and Mabel.
Blendin's Game,Mabel,"Thank you, but the wish... isn't for us."
Blendin's Game,Time Baby,Not you? But then who? Who is worthy to receive such power?
Blendin's Game,Narration,Cut to Big Gunz Laser Tag.
Blendin's Game,Soos,"Dipper? Mabel? Aw, who am I kidding? I'm not up for this(Goes towards exit and takes out coin)Heads I stay, tails I go make myself some dinosaur shaped cookies.(Flips coin)"
Blendin's Game,Narration,A kid is drinking from a water fountain when time starts to slow down. Two kids playing in the laser tag arena also slow down and stop. Soos's coin stops in mid-air.
Blendin's Game,Soos,Huh. That's... unconventional.
Blendin's Game,Dipper and Mabel,(They appear with Blendin)Soos!
Blendin's Game,Soos,G-guys!
Blendin's Game,Dipper,We're so sorry we left you hanging dude. We got caught up in this time travel junk--
Blendin's Game,Mabel,And there was a time cyclops--
Blendin's Game,Dipper,And don’t forget about the--
Blendin's Game,Mabel,Heheh.
Blendin's Game,Dipper and Mabel,Time race!
Blendin's Game,Mabel,"But, the point is, Soos, we think we know how to fix your birthday."
Blendin's Game,Soos,"Woah, really? Wait, you guys did all of that... for me?"
Blendin's Game,Blendin,And that's not all.(Presses button on wristwatch and the time wish appears)Behold your time wish! The power to alter time paradox free in any way you choose.
Blendin's Game,Dipper,We think the only thing that can make you happy is meeting your dad.
Blendin's Game,Mabel,But the choice is yours.
Blendin's Game,Soos,You mean I can finally see my dad by touching this thing? And you guys battled through time and space just to get this for me?(Takes out postcard from New Orleans)
Blendin's Game,Dipper,"What are you waiting for, Soos?"
Blendin's Game,Soos,"(Glances at postcard then puts it away)Alright, here goes nothing.(Places hand on time wish and it gives off white light. When the light clears, Mabel and Dipper get cleaned from their battles.)"
Blendin's Game,Dipper,What the--?
Blendin's Game,Mabel,Wait what?
Blendin's Game,Soos,Bam! I fixed you dudes up.
Blendin's Game,Dipper,"But Soos, what about meeting your dad?"
Blendin's Game,Soos,"Well, birthdays are supposed to be spent with the people who care about you. But you know what, that dude didn’t care about me enough to visit me once, let alone fight monsters through time and space like you dudes. I mean, you had a gladiator fight, just to make me happy. I've been being ridiculous this whole time. Whoever my dad was, he can take a hike.(Throws postcard)I know who my family is now, and it’s you dudes.(Hugs the twins)Thanks for giving me the best birthday ever."
Blendin's Game,Blendin,Are you kidding me?! Do you have any idea what you’ve just wasted?! Do you how many have died to get the time wish; the wars that were started?!
Blendin's Game,Soos,"Oh that’s not all dude.(Holds up slice of pizza)I also wished for thisslice of infinite pizza. Watch.(Takes bite of pizza, which regenerates)And it can do that for like...infinity."
Blendin's Game,Dipper,"Oh yeah, okay, cool."
Blendin's Game,Blendin,"Okay, yeah. Phew. That’s a good time wish!"
Blendin's Game,Soos,There’s still ten minutes before Laser Tag closes. You dudes wanna play?
Blendin's Game,Dipper,Yeah.
Blendin's Game,Narration,"Dipper, Mabel and Soos run into Laser Tag zone, laughing."
Blendin's Game,Dipper and Mabel,"Happy birthday, Soos!"
Blendin's Game,Narration,Cut to Credits Scene. It is 2002 and Soos is in his backyard.
Blendin's Game,Soos,"Whoa. Though I heard an explosion.(Sees screwdriver dropped by Dipper)Whoa, what’s this.(Reading print on screwdriver:)""Mystery Shack."""
Blendin's Game,Narration,Cut to Mystery Shack
Blendin's Game,Stan,"(ThrowingDurlandoutside.)""That is it! You are singlehandedly the worst handyman I've ever seen."""
Blendin's Game,Soos,"Uh, hey. Excuse me sir."
Blendin's Game,Stan,"Hey you, gumdrop. Think you can fix agolf cart?"
Blendin's Game,Soos,"Well, uh. I don’t know if I--"
Blendin's Game,Stan,"(Throws Staff shirt on Soos)Boom. You’re hired. One size fits all.(To crowd:)Step right up to the Mystery Shack folks, step right up..."

The Love God,Mabel Pines,"Whoa! That cloud looks like a chipmunk!(Points to a cloud shaped like an animal; an airplane flies out of its ""mouth"")"
The Love God,Wendy Corduroy,—Barfing an airplane.(Everyone laughs)
The Love God,Dipper Pines,It does.
The Love God,Thompson,"(Points to a waffle-shaped cloud)Uh, that looks like... uh, a cloud!"
The Love God,Lee,Boo!
The Love God,Wendy,"Thompson, stop being the worst ateverything."
The Love God,Thompson,(Chuckles)Sorry guys.(All laugh)
The Love God,Mabel,Look at the clouds! Ooh! That cloud looks like a big heart-shaped balloon!
The Love God,Dipper,Clouds don't come in colors. Thatisa balloon.
The Love God,Wendy,Oh dude! It's theWoodstickfestival.
The Love God,Dipper,"Wait, the wood what?"
The Love God,Wendy,It's this annual outdoor concert featuring Oregon's up and coming indie bands.(Takes Tambry's cell phone out of her hands)
The Love God,Tambry,Hey!
The Love God,Narration,Wendy swipes through several images of the bands.
The Love God,Wendy,"They're all coming!Scarves Indoors,Wood Grain on Everything, theLove God! You've probably seen him in that viral video."
The Love God,Love God,(In the video:)Who's ready to fall in love tonight?(The crowd cheers and he stumbles face-first into the camera)Whoa! Ow! I hope nobody's filming this!
The Love God,Dipper,"Whoa! Like a realconcertconcert? I've, uh... I've never actually been to one of those before.(Brushes elbow)"
The Love God,Wendy,"That's because you've never had an awesome crew to roll with before!(She points at Nate, Lee, Mabel and Thompson sitting together; Thompson is holding a dirty sponge)"
The Love God,Lee,"Come on, Thompson!"
The Love God,Lee & Nate,(Chanting:)Lick that sponge! Lick that sponge!
The Love God,Thompson,(Groans and licks the dirty sponge)
The Love God,"Lee, Nate, & Mabel",(Laughing)Oh!
The Love God,Nate,Can't believe he's doing it!
The Love God,Lee,(Laughs)What is he doing?
The Love God,Wendy,"When you're with us, you're in!(Points at Dipper)"
The Love God,Narration,Groaning is heard. The gang looks worried. A flock of ravens chirp and fly away from branches.
The Love God,Lee & Thompson,(Gasp)
The Love God,Mabel,Ghosty sounds! Cemetery ghosty sounds!(Shakes Dipper)
The Love God,Wendy,It's coming from that open grave.
The Love God,Nate,You look!(Elbows Lee)
The Love God,Lee,"No, you look!(Pushes Nate)"
The Love God,Dipper,"Thompson, go look."
The Love God,Nate,Heh. Nice use of Thompson.
The Love God,Lee,(Pushes Thompson toward grave)
The Love God,Thompson,"(Peering into grave, worried)Ugh..."
The Love God,Everyone but Thompson,(Chanting:)Gaze upon death! Gaze upon death!
The Love God,Narration,Thompson looks into the grave and screams. Lightning strikes.
The Love God,Narration,Cut totheme song.
The Love God,Tambry,Ugh! It's even creepier than I expected.
The Love God,Narration,"Cut to a full view so that everyone can be seen, as well as the open grave, whereRobbieis lying, holding onto a picture of Wendy."
The Love God,Robbie Valentino,(Groans)Why did she leave me?
The Love God,Wendy,Robbie?
The Love God,Robbie,"Wendy! Oh. Uh.(Chuckles nervously)Hey. What's up? Just hanging out in this grave, you know. Regular. Regular day for me."
The Love God,Lee,"Whoa, dude. We haven't seen you in, like a million years. Where have you been?"
The Love God,Wendy,"You're not still mourning our break up, are you?"
The Love God,Robbie,What? No way!(Glances at picture of Wendy and then quickly hides it)
The Love God,Wendy,"(Rubbing the back of her neck nervously)Robbie, we split up forever ago. It's really sweet you'd throw yourself into a grave for me but, man, time to move on."
The Love God,Robbie,"Huh, what? I've totally moved on.(His cell phone begins to ring)"
The Love God,Cell phoneringtone,"(Robbie singing:)Wendy, I miss you so much. I'll never move on. Never ever."
The Love God,Robbie,"(Eyes still on Wendy, Robbie throws cell phone back. It hits the headstone, breaking)That was a different Wendy. Unrelated Wendy."
The Love God,Lee,"(Quietly, to Nate:)Dude, this is getting really awkward."
The Love God,Tambry,"Yeah, the cemetery used to be fun; now it's just depressing."
The Love God,Narration,Everyone but Mabel starts walking away.
The Love God,Robbie,"(Sighs, grabs a shovel and begins to shovel dirt onto his head)"
The Love God,Mabel,Wait! You guys! He's in pain. We can't just ditch him here.
The Love God,Dipper,"Come on, Mabel, it's Robbie."
The Love God,Mabel,But he's suffering. How can I be happy if I know someone else is sad? It totally throws off my happiness chart.
The Love God,Dipper,"Mabel, trust me. If there's one thing I've learned this summer, it's not to get mixed up in needless romantic drama.(Whispering:)Besides, we're finally in with Wendy's friends. With Robbie gone, there's a good social balance. Maybe we should just let a good thing be, you know."
The Love God,Robbie,"(To a nearby vulture:)Just eat me already, man.(Vulture squawks and attacks)Ah! I was just being dramatic! Quit it! Ow! Ow! My face! Vulture!"
The Love God,Narration,"Cut to theMystery Shack, where Wendy and the twins are."
The Love God,Wendy,"Oh, man. I'm sorry you guys had to see that."
The Love God,Mabel,"You know what Robbie needs? A new girl! Romance is like gum. Once it's lost its flavor, you just cram another one in.(Chews wad of gum)"
The Love God,Wendy,"Mabel, it's not that easy."
The Love God,Mabel,It is if you're the world's greatest matchmaker! I've never had an unhappy customer; likeSoosandMelody.
The Love God,Narration,"Cut to Soos, who is standing behind a cardboard box, video chatting with Melody."
The Love God,Soos Ramirez,Watch this.(As he gradually bends down behind the cardboard box:)Walking down some actual stairs.(Melody giggles; from behind the box:)Did it look cool?
The Love God,Melody,(Giggles)The coolest.
The Love God,Narration,"Cut back to Mabel, Wendy and Dipper."
The Love God,Mabel,"Match made! And then, of course, there'sWaddlesandGompers."
The Love God,Narration,"Pan to Gompers, who is wearing a wedding veil made of saran wrap. Tin cans are tied to him with string and Waddles duck taped to his side. Wedding music plays, Gompers bleats, and then eats the saran wrap-veil."
The Love God,Mabel,Match made!
The Love God,Wendy,"That might work for a goat and a pig, but Robbie's a hopeless case."
The Love God,Mabel,"Hopeless case, ehhh?"
The Love God,Narration,"Cut to right outside of the Mystery Shack, whereStanis standing on a ladder, sewing a rainbow afro onto a stuffed gorilla."
The Love God,Stan Pines,"(As he sews, in a sing-song voice:)Putting a rainbow wig on a big white gorilla."
The Love God,Narration,Dramatic music begins to play and the wind blows the wig off of the gorilla. Stan gets off of the ladder to retrieve it.
The Love God,Stan,"What the...?(A large shadow overcasts him)Oh no.(Cut to hot air balloons)Hot air balloons.(Back to Stan, as a biker rides by him:)Fixed gear bikes."
The Love God,Narration,"A van pulls up. AWoodstick attendeeis sitting on top of it, playing his guitar and singing asong."
The Love God,Woodstick attendee,(Singing:)Singing by the open road. My sandals are so open toed.
The Love God,Stan,Folk music! It's the Woodstick Festival! Soos!(Rummaging through a suitcase full of various medieval weapons as Soos comes out)Lock down the shack and hide my shirts before anyone tie-dyes them!(Pulls out a crossbow and aims them at the hot air balloons)They're slow. I could probably take a few down.
The Love God,Soos,"Wait, Mr. Pines!(Moving Stan's crossbow out of the way as the arrow flies off; a bird caws off-screen)I've been thinking. Every year this festival comes by and every year you shun what could be potential customers."
The Love God,Stan,"You really think I could make money off of these free-loading, kale-munching freak shows?"
The Love God,Soos,You just gotta figure out what appeals to them.
The Love God,Stan,"Hmm. How do I appeal to young people? So young people are into hot air balloons, ehh?"
The Love God,Narration,Cut to Mabel at the front door of theValentino household.
The Love God,Mabel,"Alright, Mabel. Robbie's a broken teacup and you're going to piece him back together.(Rings doorbell)Okay, this could get intense.(The door opens and she gasps)"
The Love God,Mr. and Mrs. Valentino,Howdy do!
The Love God,Mrs. Valentino,Happy day!
The Love God,Mabel,"Itisintense.You'reRobbie's parents? I always thought he was, like, raised by sad wolves or something."
The Love God,Mr. Valentino,"Oh, well, he doesn't like to talk about us. He always says we're too cheerful for funeral directors.(Both laugh)Come in. Come in."
The Love God,Narration,"Cut to the inside of the house. There is a glass coffin with a corpse in it. On top of it is a tray of crackers and grapes. Mr. Valentino grabs the tray and approaches Mabel, who is sitting on the couch."
The Love God,Mr. Valentino,Cracker platter?
The Love God,Mabel,"Oh, no time for crackers, sorry. I'm here to cheer Robbie up. Cannot have a dry cracker mouth for that."
The Love God,Mrs. Valentino,(Walking to the bottom of the staircase with a plate of spaghetti in her hands; calling up to Robbie:)Robbie Stacey Valentino! There's a little girl here to see you.(To Mabel:)You go on up.(Hands Mabel spaghetti plate)And could you bring him his lunch?
The Love God,Mabel,"(Seeing that the sauce and meatballs on the spaghetti are shaped into a smile)Lady, I like your style.(Giggles and heads upstairs)"
The Love God,Mrs. Valentino,You know who would look good in a sweater like that? Mrs. Grabelson's remains!
The Love God,Mr. Valentino,"Oh, absolutely!"
The Love God,Narration,"Cut to the upstairs floor, where Mabel is walking by pictures of Robbie from over the years. She stops at his bedroom door."
The Love God,Mabel,(Knocks on door)Robbie! It's Mabel!
The Love God,Robbie,(From inside his room:)Who?
The Love God,Mabel,Remember me? I'm like girl-Dipper!
The Love God,Robbie,"(From inside his room:)Ugh, go away!"
The Love God,Mabel,"I heard a come in!(Opens the door, turning on the lights as she enters the room)"
The Love God,Robbie,"(Recoiling at the bright lights)Agh, hey! Listen, kid. Nobody in the Pines family is welcome here. In case you forgot, your stupid brother is the one who ruined myLIFE!!!(Robbie furiously tosses the spray can, shuriken, and combat army knife at the dartboard to unveil the picture of Dipper Pine)"
The Love God,Mabel,"(Setting down Robbie's lunch and pulling up a chair to sit)And Mabel's the one who's gonna fix it. Listen, Robbie, I always used to see you as a creepy jerk, like the human version of rat poison."
The Love God,Robbie,"(A bit flattered by the comparison)Uh, go on.(Taking a seat on his bed, across from Mabel)"
The Love God,Mabel,"But when I saw you in the cemetery today, I realized, Robbie's not a bad guy. He's just a heartbroken soul who needs love and gloves with fingers."
The Love God,Robbie,"Hey, fingerless gloves look awesome!"
The Love God,Mabel,"(Wagging a finger and chuckling)No they don't. Robbie, you just need a good matchmaker. I guarantee I'll find you true love or twice your sadness back."
The Love God,Robbie,"(Sighs)If I say yes, will you leave my room?"
The Love God,Mabel,(Zips Robbie's hoodie)I guarantee it.
The Love God,Narration,"Cut to Mabel in her room, sitting in front of a miniature diorama of thetownand its residents."
The Love God,Mabel,"(Cracks knuckles)Okay, Gravity Falls, who wants to go out with Robbie?(Sorting through the wooden figures of the residents)Okay.Lazy Susan? Too old.Grenda, too young.Multi-Bear? I'm putting you in the maybe pile. Who could it be? Who could it be?(Bleating and squealing from Gompers and Waddles)What's that Wompers? Someone we already know? But who could possibly be superficial and gothy enough for–?(Waddles squeals)Of course, that's it! You two really are America's favorite power couple."
The Love God,Narration,"Cut to Thompson residence, inside the garage where Wendy and her friends and Dipper are."
The Love God,Lee & Nate,(Chanting as they duck tape snacks onto Thompson:)More snacks! More snacks! More snacks!
The Love God,Thompson,I'm just happy to be included—(Nate puts tape over Thompson's mouth and Thompson's speech is muffled)
The Love God,Wendy,"Ha! This is brilliant. The perfect way to sneak cheap snacks into the concert, and it was all Dipper's idea."
The Love God,Lee and Nate,Woo! Nice.
The Love God,Wendy,Well done.
The Love God,Nate,Ideas!
The Love God,Lee,"(Bending down and placing a hand on Dipper's shoulder)Kid, I sense greatness in you."
The Love God,Dipper,"(Chuckles)Oh, well, I don't know about—"
The Love God,Lee,(Lifting Dipper up onto his shoulders)—Greatness!
The Love God,Wendy,"Alright, now everyone go home and finish getting ready for the concert."
The Love God,Nate,"Hey, don't wait up, Tambers."
The Love God,Tambry,Don't call me Tambers.
The Love God,Nate,(Laughs)Classic Tambers.
The Love God,Tambry,"(Reading a text:)""Tambry, You. Me. Date. Bring that sweet, sweet bod. Your secret admirer."""
The Love God,Narration,"Cut toGreasy's Diner, where Mabel is watching Robbie, who is quietly sitting in a booth."
The Love God,Mabel,"(AsLazy Susanwalks by her)Love is about to happen, Lazy Susan. Watch and learn."
The Love God,Narration,A bell rings as the door to the diner is opened. Tambry walks in and approaches the booth Robbie is sitting in.
The Love God,Tambry,"Ugh, Robbie?You'remy secret admirer?"
The Love God,Robbie,"Tambry? Ugh, this is just what I get for trusting a toddler. Listen, I don't think this is gonna work out. Dating somebody I already know? It's kinda like admitting defeat."
The Love God,Tambry,"Um, way to assume I'm eveninterested."
The Love God,Robbie,"Tambry, let's be real. If I wanted to date you I would have done it already. I'm just a little out of your league.(Noticing a mustard stain on the elbow of his sweatshirt)Whoa, is that mustard? Don't want to waste that bad boy.(Licks mustard stain)"
The Love God,Tambry,(Pulling out her cell phone and typing)Status update: On blind date with sociopath.
The Love God,Robbie,"Oh, sure, bring out the phone. Classic Tambers.(To a waiter:)Hey can I get some chili fries? To go."
The Love God,Mabel,What? How is this possible? I'm supposed to be the best matchmaker ever.
The Love God,Narration,"Chattering among the patrons. ""Let's go."" ""It's him."" The door to the diner bursts open and Love God storms in."
The Love God,Love God,Woo-hoo! Who's ready to fall in love tonight?
The Love God,Patrons,Love God!(Cheering)
The Love God,Love God,"(Starts up the jukebox)That's what they call me. We're rewriting history tonight, and it starts with(as he points at a male patron and a female employee:)you and you!(The man and woman look at each other and start kissing)Love is real and it's in yourface!(Chuckles; to an elderly, female patron:)What's your name, you little angel?"
The Love God,Meredith,(Chuckles)Meredith.
The Love God,Love God,"(In a hurried whisper:)Meredith, Meredith. We got a problem.(Cut to a man sitting across from them)That cutie right there is your soul mate and you're living without him."
The Love God,Meredith,"Oh, no. What do I do?"
The Love God,Love God,"Get it, girl. You know what you love.(Points at the man as Meredith runs off)Pow! Match made!"
The Love God,Narration,"Meredith runs towards the man, picks him up and laughs. Cut to Mabel, who is hiding behind a booth."
The Love God,Mabel,I must know how this works.
The Love God,Narration,"Cut to Mabel approaching Love God, who is stuffing a large sandwich into his mouth."
The Love God,Mabel,"Hi. Love God? Mabel here. Big fan. Can I just say, that was some of the finest matchmaking I've ever seen? Can you please, please,pleasetell me your secret?"
The Love God,Love God,"(Licks his fingers)Well, between you and me, let's just say my name's not exactly a coincidence.(His wings flutter)"
The Love God,Mabel,Oh. My. Love God. Are you an actuallove god?
The Love God,Love God,Call me a cherub. The internet pretty much does my job for me nowadays so I'm taking some time to focus on my rock career.(Handing her a cassette)Boom. Cassette. Boom. For you.
The Love God,Mabel,"Oh! That's... great.(Subtly drops the cassette)So, anyway. Can you make anything fall in love? Like that snake and that badger?"
The Love God,Narration,"Outside, through the window, a badger and snake are seen fighting, hissing and growling at each other."
The Love God,Love God,"Hmm, ah gee, I dunno. That might be kinda hard to—(Points at the animals)Kaboom! Match made!"
The Love God,Narration,"The animals smile, the snake wraps itself around the badger and the badger walks away."
The Love God,Mabel,They're gonna make a snadger. How are you doing that?
The Love God,Love God,"Love potion, yo. I got it all. Summer love. Young love. Anti-love. You just gotta put a little on your fingers and pow!"
The Love God,Mabel,I need that potion. How much would it cost?(Grabbing a squirrel)And will you accept squirrels as payment?
The Love God,Love God,"Whoa, no way. You might think you know what's best for people but this stuff can have major social consequences. That's why it can only be used by a serious expert."
The Love God,Woman,Love God! Sign my face!
The Love God,Love God,"(To woman:)Only if you sign mine, baby. Let's get weird!(They start kissing)"
The Love God,Narration,"Mabel carefully takes a love potion off of Love God's belt as he is facing away from her and replaces the empty slot with a squirrel. She puts a finger over her mouth and shushes the squirrel as she leaves. Cut to the kitchen of the Greasy Diner, where a chef is finishing Robbie's order of fries. Mabel approaches, the love potion in her hand."
The Love God,Mabel,Mind if I add a little something to these fries?
The Love God,Chef,(Shrugging)I don't see why not.
The Love God,Narration,"Mabel pours the contents of the potion onto the fries. Cut to Robbie and Tambry, who receive the fries."
The Love God,Robbie,(Taking a bite of a fry)Whoa. Did your whole thing suddenly get a lot more likable?
The Love God,Tambry,(Taking a bite of a fry)You don't seem as needy as I used to think you were.
The Love God,Robbie,"Hey, you wouldn't wanna maybe get outta here and, I don't know, go kiss in public a lot?"
The Love God,Tambry,"(Taking his hand)For some reason, I do.(Pulls out phone and begins to type as Robbie plays with her hair)Status update—you know what? Forget it.(Puts phone down and grabs her purse)Maybe I should stare at something other than my phone for a while."
The Love God,Mabel,Match made!
The Love God,Narration,"Cut to Thompson's garage, where Wendy, Dipper, Nate, Thompson and Lee are."
The Love God,Wendy,All right. Who's ready for the best and most overpriced day of our summer?!(All cheer)
The Love God,Thompson,"(Holding up trail mix and safety whistles)I brought a baggie of trail mix and safety whistles, in case we get separated."
The Love God,Dipper,(Pretending to clear throat:)Lame.
The Love God,Lee,This kid is a champion.
The Love God,Nate,We're just waiting on Tambry. Can't leave without Tambry.
The Love God,Mabel,"(Walks in, holding her happiness chart)Sorry, guys, but Tambry's a little busy at the moment. Wink. Wink."
The Love God,Nate,(Nervously:)What does that mean? Why are you winking?
The Love God,Mabel,Let's just say she and Robbie took a trip to Smoochville. Now everyone's happy.
The Love God,Nate,"Wait, wait. Robbie and Tambry? This can't be happening."
The Love God,Mabel,How's that?
The Love God,Nate,He knew I liked her! How could he do this?
The Love God,Lee,"Whoa, hold it. You like Tambry and you told Robbie but notme?"
The Love God,Nate,"You always make fun of my crushes, man."
The Love God,Lee,"(Wacking Nate's head)That's what we do, genius."
The Love God,Wendy,"Oh, oh! This is so like Tambry to do this. Date my ex behind my back.(Pulling her hair)I'm gonna tear her highlights out."
The Love God,Dipper,"Guys, guys. Calm down. We're gonna be late for the concert."
The Love God,Nate,"Uh, news flash, kid. I'm not going to the concert.(Pointing to Lee)Not with him."
The Love God,Lee,"Hey, that won't be a problem 'cus I'm out."
The Love God,Wendy,"Me, too!"
The Love God,Thompson,"(Frantically, as everyone but the twins leaves:)Wait! Wait! This group is all I have! Don't make me go back to having no friends! Guys!"
The Love God,Mabel,Match made?(All the stickers on her happiness chart fall off)
The Love God,Thompson,"Wait, guys. Don't go! Not my mailbox!"
The Love God,Nate,(Punches Thompson's mailbox and recoils)Ugh. Ow!
The Love God,Thompson,(Growls; to the twins:)What did you just do? I've let these guys pick on me for years to keep this group together. And now they've totally fallen apart.
The Love God,Dipper,But we were all starting to finally hang out together. I was one of the gang.
The Love God,Thompson,"Well, unless you can break up Robbie and Tambry immediately, there is no gang. I have no more friends and neither do you.(Peeling off duck tape sticking a chip to his shirt)I'm gonna eat this.(Leaves)"
The Love God,Dipper,"Mabel, what did I tell you about staying out of Robbie's personal life?"
The Love God,Mabel,"I know, I know. I just wanted to be a good matchmaker. I never should have gotten that love potion from the Love God."
The Love God,Dipper,"Wait, love potion? If you did a spell, then can't you, like, undo it?"
The Love God,Mabel,"(Gasps)That's it! If I undo the spell then everyone will be friends again! But I'm gonna need your help. Also, you are not pulling off that v-neck."
The Love God,Dipper,(Dejectedly:)I know.
The Love God,Mabel,Burn it!
The Love God,Narration,Cut to Woodstick Festival.
The Love God,Man in hot air balloon,Whoa! Ha ha!
The Love God,Narration,"Pan through various festival activities and then to Stan and Soos, who is sewing."
The Love God,Stan,"Balloon faster, Soos. We need this thing up in the air before the festival ends."
The Love God,Soos,Are you sure that that open flame should be that close to that dangling cloth and rope?
The Love God,Stan,I'm sure about everything. Now lube up those engine gears with some kerosene! More kerosene!
The Love God,Narration,"Cut to the Woodstick Festival entrance. Mabel and Dipper peek out from behind two trash cans trash bins. Thompson walks by, pulling Wendy, Nate and Lee towards the entrance."
The Love God,Thompson,"Uh! Come back, guys! Come on. The tickets were a hundred bucks. I sold my watch. You gotta come to the concert."
The Love God,Wendy,"Ew, and have to look at that? No, thanks."
The Love God,Narration,"Robbie and Tambry are seen walking together, arms linked."
The Love God,Dipper,"(To Mabel:)Ugh, they're doing that couple hug walk.(To Tambry and Robbie:)Guys you're in public! People can see you!"
The Love God,Mabel,"(Whispering:)Dipper, come on.(They sneak past the guards and hide nearLove God's van.)"
The Love God,Man,Love God. Sound check for Love God.
The Love God,Love God,"(The van's trunk opens and Love God falls out)Ow. Let's make some miracles happen. Groupies, bed-head me.(Chuckles)Love God's about to get crazy.(Walks away with his groupies)Whoa, hey, alright."
The Love God,Mabel,Now's our chance.
The Love God,Narration,"The twins run to the open trunk of the van, where Love God left his belt of love potions."
The Love God,Mabel,"(Mabel grabs the belt and looks at the love potions, which are all labeled)Here we go.(Reading the labels:)Let's see. ""Puppy-love."" ""Interspecies love."" ""Love of country music."" Ew. Oh! ""Anti-love!"" ""To reverse the effects of love potion simply spray on your victim and watch their heart die on the inside."""
The Love God,Dipper,Sounds good to me.(They turn to leave but Love God is standing in front of them)
The Love God,Love God,Hey! You're the one who's been stealing my stuff. I amnotloving this.
The Love God,Mabel,"I'm sorry, but I made a mistake and I have to fix it."
The Love God,Love God,"Kid, I tried to tell you. This stuff is way too dangerous. On my oath as a god I cannot let you—oh hey, where'd you just go?"
The Love God,Mabel,(Running away with Dipper)I'm sorry Love God! But it's for the good of my friends.
The Love God,Love God,(Chasing after them)Come back here!
The Love God,Mabel,"(Seeing Love God about to get to her, she throws the anti-love potion)Dipper catch!"
The Love God,Narration,"Dipper catches the potion and runs on stage, where The Handlebar Brothers are performing, followed by Mabel and Love God."
The Love God,Love God,(To the Handlebar Brothers:)Get those kids!
The Love God,The Handlebar Bros.,"(Standing in front of Dipper and Mabel)Halt! We mustache you to move.(The twins karate chop their mustaches, causing the brothers to butt heads and fall to the ground)"
The Love God,Dipper,(To Mabel:)Good one.(They dive into the audience and start crowd surfing)
The Love God,Mabel,(To a crowd member)Ooh! Thank you.
The Love God,Dipper,"Agh! No, no, no. Everyone is touching everything!"
The Love God,Love God,"(Doing breaststrokes as he crowd surfs)Give me back that potion.(To a crowd member, high fiving them:)Oh, hey, what's up?(To another crowd member, handing them a cassette:)Here, have a cassette.(The crowd surf ends and he lands on the ground as the twins run away)Dang it.(Flutters wings)Fly, tiny wings! Get up there!(Starts flying)Oh. I haven't had to use these in alongtime."
The Love God,Narration,"Love God continues to chase the twins. They past through a booth with Sprott drinking cider. When Sprott sees them, he pours half of his cider to the ground."
The Love God,Mabel,"Dipper, look.(Sees Robbie and Tambry. Grabs cap of spray bottle and puts it on top of potion bottle)Just one clean shot to the back of their heads and everything's fixed."
The Love God,Love God,"Sorry, kids, but you've left me no choice. Visions of heartbreak past!(Summons a pink smoke which reveals illusions of Mabel's past crushes)"
The Love God,Gabe,We're back Mabel.
The Love God,Sev'ral Timez,(Singing:)We like you now.
The Love God,"Boy from ""Tourist Trapped""",Yes. Definitely. Absolutely!
The Love God,Dipper,"(Punches illusion of boy)Ugh. Ha! You really think we'd fall for that?(Looks at Mabel, who is surrounded by the remaining illusions)"
The Love God,Mabel,"(Giggles)Sure you can all marry me. Oh, guy from the $10 bill, I forgot I had a crush on you."
The Love God,Dipper,"Dang it, Mabel. They're not real."
The Love God,Mermando,"Just give us the bottle, Mabel."
The Love God,Dipper,Mabel don't!
The Love God,Narration,Cut to Stan and Soos. Soos is still fixing up the balloon and Stan is staring at the blueprints.
The Love God,Stan,"It's finally done. When these idiots see this balloon, they'll understand that I love young people.(Shot of blueprints showinga hot air balloon that looks like Stanand has ""I HEART KIDS"" written on it)""I heart kids."" All right. Let 'er rip."
The Love God,Soos,(Soos lets the balloon go and takes a step back)Oh no! A letterrip!(Dives out of the way)
The Love God,Stan,"What the H?!(Gets crushed by the letter ""H"" from the balloon and the letter ""R"" hits the ground immediately after)"
The Love God,Narration,"Cut to the crowd. The Stan balloon looms overhead, now reading ""I EAT KIDS."" People begin shouting and screaming."
The Love God,Teen 1,I eat kids? Butwe'rekids!
The Love God,Teen 2,It's heaven's punishment for our terrible taste in everything!
The Love God,Narration,"The balloon begins to malfunction, sets fire and plummets towards a young boy and his mother who are sitting on a picnic blanket."
The Love God,Charlie,"Mommy, is the floating head going to eat us?"
The Love God,Charlie's mother,"(Holding him close and silently crying)YES, CHARLIE! YES, HE WILL!"
The Love God,Narration,"Cut back to Mabel, who is surrounded by visions of heartbreak past."
The Love God,Dipper,"(As Mabel hands the potion to ""Mermando"")Mabel it's a trick. Don't give him the—"
The Love God,Love God,"(Taking the bottle from ""Mermando"")Gotcha!(The illusions disappear)"
The Love God,Mabel,Ugh! Curse my over-sized heart.
The Love God,Love God,"Sorry, kids, but that's what happens when you mess with a god. Only a greater being from the heavens themselves could possibly stop—(Crowd screaming as the Stan balloon approaches)"
The Love God,Man,It's coming down!
The Love God,Love God,Whoa!
The Love God,Narration,"The balloon lands on Love God, causing him to drop the potion. A crowd gathers around the balloon as a man hoses it off. Mr. and Mrs. Valentino are watching from a distance."
The Love God,Mr. Valentino,"Oh, no. I hope someone didn't die."
The Love God,Mrs. Valentino,"Yes, that would be awful.(Both laugh)"
The Love God,Narration,Cut to Soos and Stan
The Love God,Stan,What's everybody crying about? In my day zeppelins fell from the sky like raindrops.
The Love God,Teen 2,It's him! The horrible old man from the sky!(People shrieking)
The Love God,Stan,"You know what? Being loved by the youth is overrated. Being feared, now that's priceless.(They walk away from the balloon wreckage, where Dipper and Mabel are standing)"
The Love God,Dipper,Love God? Are you okay?
The Love God,Mabel,(Fingers crossed; whispering:)Please be immortal. Please be immortal.
The Love God,Love God,(Gasps as he crawls out from under the wreckage)Dude. I am so over this.
The Love God,Announcer,(Offscreen; over a mic:)Love God to the stage. Love God to the stage.
The Love God,Love God,"Agh, look kid. Take it, okay. Spray everyone for all I care. You wanna mess with peoples' lives? You wanna play god? Do it. 'Cus I'm sick of it.(Walking away)Medic! I need onion rings..."
The Love God,Narration,Cut to Mabel and Dipper hiding behind a bush that Robbie and Tambry are sitting in front of.
The Love God,Dipper,"Okay, Mabel. Now's our chance. They break up and the whole friend group gets back together."
The Love God,Narration,"As Mabel is pointing the potion towards Robbie and Tambry reluctantly, Robbie turns around and sees Mabel. Dipper hides as Mabel hides the potion behind her."
The Love God,Robbie,"Mabel! Mabel, I just wanted to thank you. I've been so miserable since Wendy broke up with me that I thought my life was over, but you were right. I just needed to move on. I'm... happy? Weird, huh?"
The Love God,Tambry,"(Offscreen:)Robbie, people are commenting on our pictures.(Robbie winks at Mabel and walks away)"
The Love God,Mabel,"Dipper, maybe we shouldn't do this. I mean, every time we've played with peoples' fates, it's only made things worse.(They look at Robbie and Tambry, who are painting each others eyes with eye paint)"
The Love God,Dipper,Theyarekinda perfect for each other in a gross kinda way. But what about our friend group?
The Love God,Mabel,"Well, maybe it'll sort itself out. I mean, there's gotta be something that could bring everyone back together."
The Love God,Narration,"Cut to Thompson, who is wearing a jacket and hat to cover the snacks he is hiding and is holding a cake."
The Love God,Thompson,"Guys, I made a friendship cake. So let's all get over this, okay?(Gets hit in the head with a beach ball, dropping the cake)Ugh! My cake!(Bends down to pick it up the cake but his coat rips revealing the hidden snacks)"
The Love God,Security Guard 1,"Hey! Food from the outside!(They chase after Thompson, who screams and runs)"
The Love God,Security Guard 2,Get him!
The Love God,Narration,Cut to the rest of the gang.
The Love God,Lee,"Whoa! Hey, look!"
The Love God,Wendy,Is that Thompson?
The Love God,Narration,"Briefly cut to Thompson, who is hugging onto a utility pole. Security guard 2 blows a whistle as Security guard 1 beats Thompson with a broom. Thompson grunts as he is struck. Whistle blowing and Thompson grunting. Back to the group. All laughing."
The Love God,Nate,"Yeah, fight the machine Thompson!"
The Love God,Wendy,Throw snacks at 'em!
The Love God,Robbie,Use jerky as a weapon!
The Love God,Nate,Thompson!
The Love God,All but Dipper & Mabel,(Chanting continuously)Thompson!
The Love God,Narration,"A broom is swung at him and he cries out as he falls off, grabbing a rope and dangling down as the two security guards beat him like a piñata with a broom and a large stick. The gang continues to cheer him on (with the exception of Dipper, Mabel and Robbie). Cut to Nate and Lee. Lee stops chanting and then Nate does. Lee playfully punches Nate's shoulder and Nate does the same. Cut to Tambry and Wendy, with Lee and Nate now cheering again. Tambry stops cheering and smiles apologetically at Wendy. Wendy stops and does the same. Robbie smiles at Wendy and she smiles back apologetically."
The Love God,Mabel,(To Dipper:)I think everything just might be all right.
The Love God,Dipper,Maybe someone up there reallyisa genius matchmaker.
The Love God,Narration,"Cut to Thompson who is on the top of the utility pole, smiling at his friends."
The Love God,Thompson,All according to plan.(He's hit again and his friends continue to cheer as the guards beat him senselessly)
The Love God,Narration,"Cut to credits. ""Goat and a Pig"" plays as various pictures of Gompers and Waddles wedding and life as a couple are shown."
The Love God,(Singing),"A goat and a pig. A couple of livestock living their lives stuck together in harmony. A pig and a goat, showing the world that a pig and a goat can be family. Love's so strong, love's so big. Such a beautiful goat and a pig. Bound in matrimony now and forever. Shopping for groceries and buying a condo and filing their taxes together. Goat and a pig, goat and a pig."

Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,"The ground begins to shake, while at the table, plates and utensils clatter. The Northwests and their staff stare and gasp."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Preston,Oh no! It's...happening.
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,"Furniture and dinnerware fly at the unfortunate individuals present, while everyone either ducks or hides underneath tables."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Preston,You are my possessions!(Swats a plate away)Obey me!
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,More things fly at Preston. He screams and ducks underneath the table.
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Priscilla,This is a disaster! The party's in just 24 hours!
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Preston,Surely there's someone who can handle this sort of nonsense!(Looks at anewspaperand cuts beneath the headline to a picture ofDipper Pineswarding off agiant vampire batfromSheriff BlubsandDeputy Durland.)And I think I know just the person...

Northwest Mansion Mystery,Dipper,And why should I trust you? All you've ever done is try to humiliate me and Mabel.
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Pacifica,"Just name your price, okay? I'll give you anything!"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Mabel,"Hi, Pacifica! Excuse us!(Drags Dipper away by the arm.)Dipper! Don't you see what this means? If you help Pacifica, you could get us invites to the greatest party of all time!"

Northwest Mansion Mystery,Pacifica,This is the main room where it's been happening.
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Dipper,"Yep, this looks like the kind of room that would be haunted, all right. I wouldn't be worried, though(Holds up thejournal)—ghostsfall on a ten-category scale. Floating plates sound like a Category One."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Pacifica,So what? Are you gonna bore him back into the afterlife by reading from this book?
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Dipper,"Just gotta splash this sucker with some anointed water(Holds up small, round bottle of water),and he should be out of your probably-fake blonde hair."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Pacifica,What was that about my hair?
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Dipper,(Takes outEMF detector)Shh! I'm picking something up.
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,"Dipper walks further into the room, stopping before a tall painting of a lumberjack over the fireplace. The device loses its signal for a moment."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Dipper,"C'mon, stupid thing.(Taps device, and the signal returns)There we go."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,"Dipper looks back at the painting, and the lumberjack inside has disappeared."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Dipper,"Uh, Pacifica?"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Pacifica,"Aah!(Screams as blood dripping from above, gasps, looks up)"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,Blood swells from the mouths of the stuffed animal heads on the walls. Dipper and Pacifica shout as the fire bursts out of the fireplace.
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Animal Heads,ANCIENT SINS. ANCIENT SINS. ANCIENT SINS.(Repetitive chanting)
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,"Books, furniture, and antique weapons fly around Dipper and Pacifica, and the chandelier above crackles dangerously."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Pacifica,"Dipper, what is this?!"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Dipper,It's... a Category Ten.
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,"The bottle of anointed water breaks, and Dipper and Pacifica scream."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Pacifica,(Screams; grabs Dipper)
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Deer Animal Head,ANCIENT BLOOD AND BLACKENED SKIES.
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Animal Heads,THE FOREST DARK SHALL ONCE MORE RISE.
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Pacifica,"(Shakes Dipper by the collar)What do we do, what do we do?!"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Dipper,Don't worry. It can't get worse than this!
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,"The fire flames up again, and Dipper and Pacifica hide under a table while a giant black skeleton emerges from the fire. A body forms around the skeleton of an enormous lumberjack with a beard made of fire and an ax in his head."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Ghost of Northwest Manor,"I smell... A NORTHWEST!(Ax materializes in his hand, begins dragging ax along the floor)Come out, come out, wherever you are!"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Pacifica,Hurry! Read through your dumb book already!
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Dipper,"(Whispering:)I'm looking! And it's not dumb, okay? This book is gonna save our lives! Alright, here we go. Advice:(Holdsportable black lightover book, which reads ""PRAY FOR MERCY!"")Aww, seriously?!"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,"The table floats out from over them, revealing them to the ghost. They scream."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Ghost,"YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE COME HERE!(Slices at them with the ax, they dodge)"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Pacifica,This way! Hurry!
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,"Dipper and Pacifica flee down the hall, pursued by the ghost. Cut to Preston opening the doors to the guests."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Preston,"Welcome, dukes and duchesses, sultans and sportsmen."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Sportsman,"Yo, what up, Presto?"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Preston,"And, reclusive 102-year-old mayor of Gravity Falls,Mayor Befufflefumpter."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Mayor,"(Gestures to vultures circling overhead)It's okay, they're with me."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Preston,Tonight we will enjoy only the finest of tastes and only the snootiest of laughter.
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Snooty Rich Guy,(Laughs in a stereotypical French manner)
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Preston,That's the ticket!
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,Cut to Candy at the fondue fountains.
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Candy,"(As she switches fondues)Cheese, chocolate, cheese, chocolate–"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Mabel,"Candy, listen to me carefully. You're caught in a sweet-savory loop. Put the fondue fork down."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Candy,"I want to, but I can't."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,Glass rings to gather everyone's attention.
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Butler,Introducing Baron Marius von Fundshauser.
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Marius,(Enters dramatically)Guten tag!
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Mabel,"Guten take-me-now!(Makes a dash for Marius, is held back by Grenda and Candy.)"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Grenda,"Mabel, we had a truce!"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Candy,"Yes yes, a truce! Uh, Grenda? Can you go fetch us some fancy napkins?"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Grenda,"Wow, okay!"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Candy,"Listen, Mabel, I don't know if I can follow this truce! He is too adorable!"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Mabel,"Huh, me too, Candy. But what do we do? He's unattainable!"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Candy,"What if we flirt with him as a team? With our cuteness combined, one of us might have a chance!"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Mabel,"It is the perfect plan, but what about Grenda?"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Candy,"I love Grenda, Mabel. But these boys are fancy! Her aggressive flirting style might scare them away!"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,Shot of Grenda pointing at a boy's jacket.
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Grenda,"What's on your shirt?(Smacks boy's nose with finger)Haha, gullible! ...Loser!"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Mabel & Candy,(Nod grimly to each other)
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,"Cut to Pacifica leading Dipper down a decorated hallway, pursued by the laughing ghost. Overhead shot of a courtyard."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Pacifica,Hurry! Through the garden! Watch out for peacocks!
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,"Dipper, head in journal, hits a peacock as they go. Dipper and Pacifica muddy their shoes on the garden path as they run."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Dipper,"Come on, come on–(Flips through journal desperately)I got it! A haunted painting can only be trapped in a silver mirror.(Points ahead of them)Look! There's a silver mirror right there!"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,"Dipper and Pacifica run towards a pristine white room, where a large, rectangular mirror hangs on the rear wall. Pacifica grabs his arm, stopping him before he can enter."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Pacifica,Wait! Don't go in there! This room has my parents' favorite carpet pattern! They'll lose it if we track mud in there!
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Dipper,"What? Are you serious?!(Tries to force his way into the room, but Pacifica holds him back)"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Pacifica,We'll find another way!
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Ghost,(From a distance)Come out!(Laughs)
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Dipper,"Pacifica, we don't have time for this! Let me through!"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Pacifica,"No, my parents will kill me!"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Dipper,Why are you so afraid of your parents?!
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Pacifica,You wouldn't understand!
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,"Pacifica tugs on Dipper's journal, tripping them both and causing them to fall through a painting of a skeleton in a crown and robe into a dark, dusty, cobwebbed room. The ghost flies past in the opposite direction."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Dipper,Ahh... What is this place?
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Pacifica,That's weird. I don't even know where this room is.
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Dipper,Hopefully the ghost doesn't either.
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Pacifica,"Yeah, maybe we're safe.(A sheet behind her seems to come alive, reaching out to swallow her)"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Dipper,"Pacifica, watch out!"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Pacifica,Aaaaah!
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Ghost,"YOUR FATE IS SEALED!(Pursues Pacifica, knocking over a box of silver dishes, utensils, and other objects)"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Dipper,A silver mirror!
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Pacifica,"(Runs, tripping over a loose floorboard)Ow!"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Ghost,"PREPARE TO DIE, NORTHWEST!(Raises ax and charges Pacifica.)"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,"Dipper dashes in front of Pacifica, holding the silver mirror. Dipper and Pacifica are knocked out of a first floor window, become entangled in a window drape and fall down a short hill."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Pacifica,"Did you get him?(They look at the mirror, still held by Dipper.)"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Ghost,(From inside the mirror:)NO! FREE ME!(Pounds on mirror's interior.)
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Dipper & Pacifica,Haha! Yes!
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Pacifica,"We did it!(Hugs Dipper. Eyes widen when she realizes what she's doing, and then she backs off awkwardly. She clears her throat and holds out a dollar, avoiding eye contact with Dipper)Can Ipayyou to pretend that never happened?"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,"Cut to Northwest Manor garden, where Preston and Priscilla Northwest are meeting Dipper, while Pacifica and a waiter stand nearby."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Preston,"Well, Pacifica, you really found the right man for the job.(Snaps fingers, butler shakes Dipper's hand)"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Priscilla,We can't thank you enough.(Pauses)That's enough.(Butler stops shaking Dipper's hand)
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Dipper,"Hey, just holding up my end of the deal.(Turns to leave)"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Pacifica,"Wait, leaving already? You're at the world's best party, dummy."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Dipper,"Heh, I'd love to stay, but I've got a Category 10 ghost to dispose of.(Walks into a garden pillar)Aah! Heh heh... Category 10.(Both laugh as Dipper leaves)"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,Cut to outer garden as Dipper walks away.
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Dipper,"(To self:)Call me crazy, but, maybe she's not that bad after all."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Ghost,(Laughs from mirror)
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Dipper,"What are you laughing about, man? I defeated you."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Ghost,"You've been had, boy. You remind me of me a hundred and fifty years ago."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Dipper,What do you mean?
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Ghost,"(Flashback montage; Voiceover:)One hundred and fifty years ago this day, the Northwests asked us lumber-folk to build them a mansion atop the hill. We were told t'would be a service to thetown, that once a year they would throw a grand party, and all would share in the bounty. It took years of backbreaking labor and sacrifice, but when it was time for the grand party they promised the common folk of the town, they refused to let us in."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Flashback Lumberjack,"(As he pounds on mansion gate)YOU PROMISED, NORTHWEST!"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Ghost,"(Voiceover:)With the trees gone, the mudslides began. While they partied and laughed, I was swept away by the storm!(Offscreen, a swept-up ax embeds itself in the lumberjack's head as he screams)And so I said with final breath, ""One-fifty years I'll return from death, and if the gate's still closed to town, wealthy blood will stain the ground!"" A curse passed down until this day.(Shot ofNorthwest ancestorwriting down the curse and holding it in hand, then transitions to Preston, curse warning in hand, nodding to Pacifica)"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Dipper,"So, wait a minute—the Northwestsknewthis haunting was coming, and they tricked me into helping them to avoid ghostly justice? ...I'll be right back."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,Cut to manor interior.
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Preston,"Thank you so much for coming, Mayor. As a sign of our respect, please take this chimp servant. Keep him away from bright lights, he gets... grabby."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Dipper,"(Offscreen)Northwests!(Mansion main door opens, revealing Dipper pointing at Preston accusingly)You've got some explaining to do!"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Pacifica,"(Dashes in from another room)Dipper, you came back!"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Dipper,(Points at Pacifica angrily)You lied to me! All of you did! All you had to do was let the townsfolk into the party and you could've broken the curse! But you made me do your dirty work instead!
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Preston,"(Leans down threateningly; Dipper glares at him, unfazed)Look at who you're talking to, boy. I'm hosting a party for the most powerful people in the world. You think they'd come here if they had to rub elbows withyourkind?"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Dipper,"(Outraged)""Mykind?""(Looks at Pacifica)I was right about you all along. You're just as bad as your parents. Another link in the world's worst chain!"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Pacifica,"I'm sorry, they made me! I should've told you, but–(Preston rings the bell. Blushing, Pacifica steps back)"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Preston,"Enjoy the party! It's the last time you and your kind will ever come.(Dipper glares and marches away, chimp servant offers him a tray)No no! Those aren't for him."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,"Cut to mansion exterior, where Dipper is about to exorcise the ghost."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Dipper,"Stupid Northwests, making me do their exorcism for them. ""Exodus demonus, spookus scarus, aintafraidus noghostus–"""
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Ghost,"(From mirror:)Dipper, Dipper! Please let me get my vengeance on the Northwests! You hate them as much as I."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Dipper,"Hey, I feel you. It's just, my sister's in there, and you seem alittleunstable, man."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Ghost,"Very well, boy. Then... before you banish my soul, may these tired lumber eyes gaze upon the trees one final time?"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Dipper,"Uh... I guess.(Holds mirror up to the forest)Go nuts, man."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,"The ghost cackles madly and the mirror becomes red-hot. Dipper drops it as it burns his hand, and it shatters on the ground, releasing the ghost back to the mansion."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Dipper,Aah!
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Ghost,Yes! VENGEANCE!
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Dipper,Oh no! Mabel!
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,"Cut to manor interior, main ballroom."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Mabel,"(To Marius:)Hi! I'm Mabel. So, Australia, huh? Do you guys eat kangaroo meat over there, or... are they... strictly pets?"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Marius,I am from Austria.
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Mabel,(Laughs nervously; taps Candy's shoulder)Tag! Tag!
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Candy,I am Candy! I love the tiny hats you wear on your shoulders.
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Mabel,"Hi! If you were a boat, do you know what kind you'd be? A dream boat. That's what kind."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Candy,(Elbows Mabel)You are tagged out!
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Mabel,I tag back in!
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Candy,You can't do that!
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Mabel,I can tag myself! It's allowed!
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Candy,"No, no!(Unintelligible arguing)"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,Marius nervously walks away as the two girls continue to argue.
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Grenda,AHEM! What exactly was all that? You were flirting with Marius without me!
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Candy,"We are sorry, Grenda, it's just..."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Mabel,Your flirting style can come off as a bit... intense...
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Grenda,"(Blushing)Oh, I see! You think I shouldn't be myself just because I'm in this stupid mansion! I thought you liked my style!"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Candy,We do! But these boys might not!
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Grenda,"Oh, then I guess they wouldn't like this, either! Hey, Marius!"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Marius,Ja?
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Grenda,You've got something... on your shirt!
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,"Marius looks down at his shirt, and Grenda smacks his nose. Marius shouts, Mabel and Candy gasp angrily. All three girls walk away in different directions. Marius glances after Grenda, starry-eyed."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,"Cut to Preston, ringing a glass."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Preston,Thank you all for coming! I think we can all say this party was a rousing success.
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Sportsman,"I guess you could say it was a slam dunk, Presto."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Preston,"(Unenthusiastic:)Yes, yes, I guess, sure.(Happily:)A toast! To our family name–(Glasses shatter, sound of laughter)What?!"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Ghost,"(Emerges from fireplace)GENERATIONS LOCKED AWAY, MY REVENGE SHALL HAVE ITS DAY!(Glowing beam extends from arm)"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Mayor,"Ah, the grim reaper! I'd been wondering when you would arri– Aaah!(Beam hits mayor, turns mayor and wheelchair to wood. He falls over)"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,Guests begin running and screaming in every direction. The ghost fires the beam at everyone he can see. Dead taxidermy animals come alive and advance on the guests.
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Priscilla,"Preston, what are we going to do?"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Preston,Prepare the panic room.(Punches stuffed squirrel off of his shoulder)
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,"The front doors fly open with a flash of lightning and thunder, revealing Dipper, soaking from the rain, agape in shock at what he sees. One of the guests reaches out towards him."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Terrified Guest,"Please, help me!(Freezes, wooden)"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Dipper,"(Jumps back)Whoa, that is messed up!"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Ghost,(Laughs)JUST ONE WAY TO CHANGE YOUR FATES: A NORTHWEST MUST OPEN THE PARTY GATES!
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Dipper,A Northwest? Pacifica!(sees a flickering light)
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,"Cut to hallway with secret room. Inside, Pacifica is sitting on the floor miserably flickering a flashlight on and off."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Dipper,"(Running to Pacifica)Pacifica! There you are! The ghost is turning everyone to wood, and he just started rhyming, for some reason?(Tugs Pacifica's hand)I need your help!(Pacifica pulls her hand away)Pacifica?"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Pacifica,"(Despondent)You wanna know why this room was locked up? This is what I found in here. A painted record of every horrible thing that my family's ever done. Lying, cheating, and then there's me. I lied to you just because I'm too scared to talk back to my stupid parents!(Takes off diamond earrings and throws them at a painting of Preston and Priscilla)You were right about me. Iamjust another link in the world's worst chain."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Dipper,"(Sighs)Pacifica, I'm sorry about what I said earlier. But just because you're your parents' daughter doesn't mean you have to be like them. It's not too late."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Ghost,(Offscreen)IT'S TOO LATE!
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Dipper,Oh no!(They run into the main hall)
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Ghost,You are all wood!
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Dipper & Pacifica,(Scream)
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,"Shot of Candy, Mabel, and Grenda as angry, arguing, wooden statues. Dipper looks determined and starts to run towards the ghost."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Pacifica,"Dipper, wait!"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Dipper,"(Picks up a silver platter)Alright ghost, prepare to get–(Energy beam knocks the journal out of Dipper's hand, and he drops the platter)ah! No, wait!(Ghost fires a burst that hits Dipper)No no no! No, someone help! SOMEONE HEEEELLLLP...!(Dipper freezes ina familiar form)"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,Pacifica gasps. A grandfather clock strikes midnight.
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Ghost,"A forest of death, a lesson learned. And now the Northwest Manor will BURN!(Laughs as the manor sets fire, starting with a portrait of Preston, Priscilla, and a young Pacifica)"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Pacifica,"Hey, ugly! Over here! You want me to let in the townsfolk? 'Cause I'll do it! Just change everyone back!"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Ghost,YOU WISH TO PROVE YOURSELF? PULL THAT LEVER AND OPEN THE GRAND GATE TO THE TOWN! FULFILL YOUR ANCESTORS' PROMISE!
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Preston,"(Coming out of an underground hatch with Priscilla Northwest and a butler)Pacifica Elise Northwest, stop this instant! We can't let the town see us like this! We have a reputation to uphold! Now come into the panic room. There's enough mini-sandwiches and oxygen to last you, me, and a butler a full week.(Whispers:)We'll eat the butler!"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,"Pacifica looks at Dipper's wooden statue, and reaches for the lever."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Preston,You dare disobey us?!
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,"(Preston rings his bell; Pacifica nervously reaches for the lever as he continues to ring it, straining and groaning as she tries to resist before finally fixing her face angrily and determinedly. Preston still keeps ringing the bell.)"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Preston,Dingally dingally! Is this bell broken?!
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Pacifica,(Stomps foot.)Our family name is broken! And I'm gonna fix it!(Pulls the lever.)
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Ghost,(Gasps.)
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,"Outside, the main gate swings open, admitting the surprised citizens of Gravity Falls."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Tyler,Git it! Git it!
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,Everybody cheers as they make their way to the manor.
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Ghost,"YES, YES, IT'S HAPPENING! MY HEART, ONCE AS HARD AS OAK, now grows soft like more of a... birch, or something."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,The guests and manor itself fade back from the wooden forms.
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Dipper,(Inhales sharply)
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Ghost,"Pacifica, you are not like the other Northwests. I feel... lumber justice.(Fades to nothing, the ax in his head falling to the floor and sinking into the ground)"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,"There is a rumbling noise, and the doors of the manor burst open as the people of Gravity Falls enter the party."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Manly Dan,"Aw, yes! Yeah!(Jumps into cider fountain)"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Preston,"Good lord, the riffraff! They're everywhere!(Tyler giggles, picking up a fork and placing it down again)That's not how the fork should be placed!"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Mabel,"Oh, man, what happened?"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Grenda,Ahem!
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Candy,Grenda! We are so sorry.
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Mabel,We shouldn't have left you behind.
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Grenda,"It's okay. Maybe I do need to work on my flirting. Come on, let's go dunk our heads in some cheese and chocolate. Friends?"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Mabel & Candy,Friends!(Group hug.)
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Marius,"Wait! Don't go! Grenda, was it? I must speak with you. There is something about you, I can't get you out of my head. You're so bold and confident. I know you are probably out of my league, but, might I give you mein phone number?"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Grenda,I don't have a phone! Write it on myface!
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Mabel,Whoa-ho-ho! Go Grenda!
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Candy,I guess we shouldn't have sold her short. I call bridesmaid!
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Mabel,What? I call co-bridesmaid!
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Dipper,"Man, if your family hates you for this, they're idiots. This is great."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Pacifica,Enjoy it while it lasts. Next year I'm sure they're just gonna lock everyone out again.
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Dipper,Hey. Guess what we're standing on.
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,"Pacifica gasps, seeing her parents' favorite white carpet pattern. Then she laughs, and she and Dipper have some fun knocking things onto the carpet."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Pacifica,"Haha. But seriously, I'd better go and find someone to clean this up.(Walks away.)"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,McGucket,Woo! Scobbity-doo! Hornswaggle m' goat knees!
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Dipper,"Whoa-ho-ho, what's up, McGucket? Hey–(McGucket grabs Dipper by the shoulders and they dash around a corner to speak in private.)"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,McGucket,"Dipper! I've been lookin' for ya. I fixed thelaptop. I been doin' calculations, and I think something terrible is comin'! The apocalypse! The End Times!"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Dipper,"(Pinches the bridge of his nose, sighing.)You know what, McGucket? How about we talk about this stuff tomorrow? It's a party. Let's have some fun for once, huh?(Walks off, smiling)"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,McGucket,But–!
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,"McGucket plucks the laptop from his beard and opens it. The screen reads ""IMMINENT THREAT"" with what appears to be a countdown, showing less than twenty-four hours until the portal activates."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,McGucket,"Oh, this is bad! Something's coming! Something big!"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,"The camera pans to just above McGucket, where a tapestry depicts a triangle eye which looks similar toBill Cipherin the sky above a burning landscape and cowering figures. Below the worshippers are skulls and bones lying on the ground."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,Cut to credits. In a coat closet within the manor.
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Agent Powers,"(Disguised; in a fake accent:)Quick, in here, my darling!(Pulls disguisedAgent Triggerinto the room after him.)"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Agent Trigger,(High pitched voice:)A moment alone at last!
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Powers,"You can drop the act, Trigger.(Both remove disguises.)They're seeing activity on the machine. It's go time."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Trigger,Roger that.(Salutes.)
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Powers,Where's my phone?
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Trigger,I don't have it.
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Powers,"Yes you do, it was in your purse."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Trigger,"Oh, so I'm just supposed to hold on to everything for you?"
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Powers,I asked you when we were in the car!
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Trigger,Why do we always have to fight at parties?!
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Tambry,(Opens door; pauses)Not even gonna ask.(Shuts door)
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,"Cut to end card, a cryptogram showing a totem-looking wooden carving."
Northwest Mansion Mystery,Narration,End episode.
Not What He Seems,Narration,"Theepisode begins with an establishing shot ofGravity Falls, late at night. A blue pulsing light glows. Then, a shot of thevending machineinsidethe Shack, which is also periodically back-lit by the pulsing blue light. Cut toStan Pinesin theunderground laboratorybeneath the Shack, working on theuniverse portal. Stan pulls a lever, and green fluid pumps into large, glass tanks."
Not What He Seems,Stan,"Come on, come on. Should be just enough to finish the job.(Removes his fez and glove, and without knowing, wipes toxic waste on his forehead, which sizzles and briefly glows green)Whew. Can't be too careful with this stuff."
Not What He Seems,Narration,"Red lights flash and a buzzer goes off. Stan smiles and turns to look at screen. The screen reads ""EVENT INITIALIZED"" and an eighteen hour countdown begins."
Not What He Seems,Stan,"(Reading fromJournal 1:)""Warning,"" blah blah blah, ""Extreme usage could result in minor gravity anomalies."" Can it, Poindexter!(Slams journal shut)I've come this far. I'm not givin' up now!(Pushes a button, and the portal begins to spin)Yes, this is it."
Not What He Seems,Narration,"Stan's fez floats off of his head. Outside the Shack, rocks float off the ground, along withGompersthe goat. A boat lifts out ofthe lake. In thescrapyard, broken-down cars and junk lift off the ground, and insideMcGucket's makeshift shack, a blue light blinks, illuminating the sleeping and floating McGucket and the functioninglaptopwhich now reads ""ACTIVE"" under an image of the portal. Back in the Shack,DipperandMabel, as well asWaddles, float off their beds, but sleep undisturbed. There is a resounding ""thunk"" as everything in town touches back down to the ground."
Not What He Seems,Stan,"It's gonna be a bumpy ride, but it'll all be worth it.(Synchronizes what looks like a large wristwatch with the steadily ticking countdown, still displayed on the monitor)Just eighteen more hours. Finally, everything changes. Today."
Not What He Seems,Narration,A draft blows the journal shut.
Not What He Seems,Narration,"Cut to shortenedtheme song. Cut to Mabel, running down the halls, followed by a tired Dipper."
Not What He Seems,Mabel,(Running down hall)Ahh! It's here it's here it's here!
Not What He Seems,Dipper,(Sighs)
Not What He Seems,Mabel,"(To Dipper:)Okay, so I was just opening random doors - because I'm a creep - when I found something amazing!"
Not What He Seems,Dipper,"(While rubbing his eyes)If it was worth waking up at seven AM for, thatwillbe amazing."
Not What He Seems,Mabel,"Feast your eyes!(Opening door to reveal closet filled with various types of fireworks in a box labeled ""DO NOT TOUCH!"")"
Not What He Seems,Dipper,Whoa!
Not What He Seems,Mabel,(Puts hand on Dipper's shoulder)Bro. Bro. We're both thinking it.
Not What He Seems,Dipper and Mabel,Crazy rooftop fireworks party!
Not What He Seems,Stan,"(Marches up to them)Not so fast, kids! There is no way on earth you're setting off those dangerous, illegal fireworks...(Smiles and bends down to put his arms around their shoulders)...without me."
Not What He Seems,Narration,"Cut to roof. Dipper is grabbing a icy-pop from the cooler. Mabel is standing excitedly next to Stan, who is sitting on the lounge chair with a litsparklerandRoman candle."
Not What He Seems,Stan,"Here you go, sweetie.(Lights Mabel'sskyrocketwith a sparkler)Set something on fire for your Grunkle Stan."
Not What He Seems,Mabel,(Aiming the skyrocket; Screaming:)I AM THE GOD OF DESTRUCTION!(Skyrocket shoots off)
Not What He Seems,Narration,Sheriff BlubsandDeputy Durlandapproach the Mystery Shack as the fireworks go off.
Not What He Seems,Blubs,Hold on a minute. Do you have a permit for those?
Not What He Seems,Dipper,Uh...
Not What He Seems,Stan,"Uh, do you have a permit for being totally lame?(He and the twins laugh)"
Not What He Seems,Mabel,Heyoooo!
Not What He Seems,Blubs,"(Chuckles)Well, I can't argue with that.(Walking away and waving)Carry on."
Not What He Seems,Stan,(Laughs)But seriously though we should probably clean this mess up.
Not What He Seems,Narration,Pans out to a full view of the Mystery Shack; there are many small fires around and on it. The rope holding up the flags snaps.
Not What He Seems,Mabel,With water balloons?
Not What He Seems,Stan,I don't see why not.
Not What He Seems,Narration,"Cut to Stan sitting outside on the couch drinking aPitt Cola, and Dipper running away from Mabel, who is throwing water balloons at him."
Not What He Seems,Dipper,(Laughs as he runs. Throws water balloon which goes about a foot before falling onto the ground)Seriously?
Not What He Seems,Mabel,"(Hits him with a water balloon, knocking him back. Runs by, screaming in a tribal-like fashion)"
Not What He Seems,Stan,Ah. This is what Saturdays are for. Doing dumb things forever.
Not What He Seems,Dipper and Mabel,(As they jump onto the pile of water balloons)DUMB THINGS FOREVER!(Land on the water balloons which all pop into a big burst of water)
Not What He Seems,Stan,"(As a splash of water comes at him:)Whoa, there!(Laughs)"
Not What He Seems,Mabel,(Holding up an icy-pop)To Grunkle Stan! Not just a great uncle...
Not What He Seems,Dipper,The greatest uncle!(He and Mabel throw water balloons at Stan)
Not What He Seems,Stan,"(Laughs)Alright, alright. I tell you it's unnatural for siblings to get along as well as you do."
Not What He Seems,Mabel,(Waves hand dismissively)Ha-ha! Don't worry. We've still got plenty of summer left(Attacking Dipper in a hug)to drive each other crazy!
Not What He Seems,Dipper,"(Pushes Mabel away with a water balloon, which falls on her face)"
Not What He Seems,Stan,"(Laughs nervously and frowns)Yeah, plenty of summer left.(Rubbing the back of his head nervously as Dipper and Mabel approach him)Kids, there's something I, uh, something I should tell you. It's um(Scratches chin)Well it's complicated. I... I'm gonna go refresh my soda.(Walks away. Cut to him walking alone behind the bushes)Enjoy it while you can, Stan. They'll find out sooner or later. Today's the day."
Not What He Seems,Narration,A glowing red dot appears on Stan's fez.
Not What He Seems,Stan,"What is that, a ladybug?(Slaps it)"
Not What He Seems,Narration,More red dots target Stan.
Not What He Seems,Stan,What the--? Oh no!
Not What He Seems,Narration,A masked agent pins Stan down.Agent Triggerapproaches.
Not What He Seems,Agent Trigger,(Into walkie-talkie:)Target secure! Take the house!
Not What He Seems,Narration,"Several helicopters fly above the Shack. Cut to a conufused Dipper and Mabel, surrounded by a handful of agents."
Not What He Seems,Mabel,What the--?
Not What He Seems,Dipper,(Gasps)
Not What He Seems,Agent,(Into walkie-talkie:)Kids are secure. Roof team! Go!
Not What He Seems,Narration,"Several agents rappel out of a helicopter. Cut to the Mystery Shack attic, where agents crash in and cock their weapons."
Not What He Seems,Agent 2,Clear!
Not What He Seems,Narration,"Another couple agents rush through the gift shop, wielding a bat. Another crashes through a window, using a rope."
Not What He Seems,Agent 3,Clear!
Not What He Seems,Narration,Yet another agent breaks through Dipper and Mabel's window. Waddles is seen standing in confusion. He squeals when the agent tackles him.
Not What He Seems,Agent 4,Pig secure! We have secured a pig!
Not What He Seems,Narration,The agents wrap yellow police caution-tape around the Shack. Several police cars are parked outside. An agent leads a struggling Stan in handcuffs.
Not What He Seems,Stan,"(Being led to the government vehicle)Ugh! Hey, hands off, you stooge!"
Not What He Seems,Agent,(Plants Stan's face on the trunk of the police car)
Not What He Seems,Stan,Aah! I don't understand! What did I do that warrantsthismuch arresting?
Not What He Seems,Narration,"Dipper, Mabel andAgent Powersand Agent Trigger walk up."
Not What He Seems,Dipper,The government guys? I thought you goteaten by zombies!
Not What He Seems,Trigger,We survived. Barely.
Not What He Seems,Powers,I used Trigger as a human shield. He cried like a baby.(Walks over)
Not What He Seems,Trigger,What? Hey! Not in front of the special-ops guys!
Not What He Seems,Powers,(Holds up digital tablet)This is security footage of a government waste facility.(Pan in on screen where footage of a person in a radiation suit stealing barrels is shown as Powers continues to talk)At o'four hundred hours last night someone robbed three hundred gallons of dangerous waste.
Not What He Seems,Stan,What? You think that's me?
Not What He Seems,Powers,"Don't play dumb with us, Pines."
Not What He Seems,Stan,"But-but I actuallyamdumb!(As he is led away by an agent)Last night, I was restocking the gift shop. I swear!"
Not What He Seems,Mabel,"Wait! Grunkle Stan! You've got the wrong guy! Our Grunkle Stan might shoplift the occasional tangerine, but he's not some evil super villain!"
Not What He Seems,Powers,"(Bending down to get at eye-level with the twins)Listen, kid. We've been watching your family all summer and we've seen some disturbing things. But nothing as dangerous as what your uncle is hiding. Somewhere hidden in this shack is a doomsday device!(To Trigger, handing him the tablet:)Trigger, you take the children. I'll talk to the old man.(To the twins:)Sorry to break it to you kids(Puts on sunglasses)but you don't know your uncle at all.(Walks away)"
Not What He Seems,Narration,Trigger snaps his fingers and points at the children. Two agents approach the twins.
Not What He Seems,Agent 5,"(Bends down and takes Mabel's icy-pop, holding an evidence bag)Icy-pop. Clear."
Not What He Seems,Mabel,(Reaching up toward her icy-pop)Hey!
Not What He Seems,Narration,"The other agent leads the twins away. Once they are gone the first agent who took Mabel's icy-pop looks to his left to see if the coast is clear and then licks the icy-pop. Mabel and Dipper are led into a police car, and the door is shut behind them. Looking out the window they can see Stan in a government vehicle."
Not What He Seems,Stan,"(Looks at them and taps on the window with his cuffed hands)Kids, you gotta believe me! For once I'm actually innocent!(As the car drives off)Kids!"
Not What He Seems,Wendy Corduroy,(Walking towards the Mystery Shack; In a sing-song voice:)Headin' into work. Doo-doo-doo-doo-doooo.
Not What He Seems,Agent 6,"Ground team! Move, move, move!"
Not What He Seems,Agent 7,Break down the door!
Not What He Seems,Narration,Two agents break down door to the Mystery Shack and a helicopter flies over the Shack.
Not What He Seems,Wendy,(Turns around and starts walking away)Or maybe not.
Not What He Seems,Narration,"Cut to theGravity Falls police station, Stan getting his mug shots taken, his prints taken, and then Stan sitting in front of a bulletin board with various pictures attached to strings that all meet up to a picture of him."
Not What He Seems,Powers,"Stanford Pines, you stand accused of theft of government waste, conspiracy, and possession of illegal weapons. How do you plead to these charges?"
Not What He Seems,Stan,"Uh, guilticent! I mean, innoguilty! Um... can I have my phone call?"
Not What He Seems,Narration,"Cut to shot of a fast food restaurant called ""Yumberjacks,"" whereSoosis at the drive-thru."
Not What He Seems,Soos,"Okay, gimme whatever you got that comes with a free toy."
Not What He Seems,Stan,(Through walkie-talky:)Soos!
Not What He Seems,Soos,Mr. Pines?(Touches drive-thru lumberjack-speaker)Is this some sort of... possession situation?
Not What He Seems,Stan,(Through walkie-talky:)Just pick up!
Not What He Seems,Soos,"(Picks up walkie-talky)Mr. Pines, what happened? I heard you got arrested or something? I had to go get some panic food."
Not What He Seems,Stan,"(Through walkie-talky:)Listen, I need something from you. You know that vending machine in the gift shop? I need you to guard it with yourlife. No matter what happens, no matterwhotalks to you, don't let them touch that machine.(Walky-talky makes whining sound as Stan cuts out)"
Not What He Seems,Soos,Time for a repair guy(Adjusts hat)to become a repairman.
Not What He Seems,Drive-thru employee,"(Sticks arm out to hand Soos his kid's meal)Sir, your Junior Yum-Yum Baby-Time Kiddo Meal?"
Not What He Seems,Soos,"Just put one in my mouth.(Employee opens box, removes a fry, and places it in Soos' mouth. Soos makes munching noises as he chews)Let's do this.(Tires screech, Soos drives wildly through a hedge)"
Not What He Seems,Narration,Cut to Dipper and Mabel in the car with Trigger. Powers speaks through a video link at the front of the vehicle.
Not What He Seems,Powers,We've got Mr. Pines in custody. Our men are searching the shack for that device. You take care of those kids.
Not What He Seems,Mabel,(Gasps)What're you gonna do to us?
Not What He Seems,Trigger,We'll be taking you to child services.
Not What He Seems,Mabel,Boo!
Not What He Seems,Trigger,"In the meantime,(Presses buttons)enjoy some mindless reality TV, designed to pacify you and make you stop asking questions."
Not What He Seems,Narration,Cut to television screen. A surgeon in scrubs stands over a patient laying on a stretcher.
Not What He Seems,Surgeon,I'm about to make the incision...
Not What He Seems,Justin,"KER-PRANK!(Jumps out of a potted plant, surgeon screams, screen reads ""KER-PRANK'Din large font)"
Not What He Seems,TV Announcer,"You're watching ""KER-PRANK'D"" with Justin Kerprank!"
Not What He Seems,Narration,Cut back to the twins.
Not What He Seems,Mabel,"Dipper, this is crazy. There's no way Stan was stealing hazardous waste! We gotta clear his name!"
Not What He Seems,Dipper,"(Thinks, then spots the camera at the front of the car)Hmm...wait a minute, the security tapes! Didn't Stan say he was restocking the gift shop last night? If we could get the Mystery Shack's surveillance tapes, we could prove he's innocent!"
Not What He Seems,Mabel,"We just need to think of a way out of here. Think, Mabel...(Looking out car window)Think."
Not What He Seems,Narration,Their vehicle comes up beside a logging truck driven byManly Dan.
Not What He Seems,Mabel,"(Notices aSev'ral Timezbumper sticker on the back and knocks on the window to get Dan's attention, writing on the foggy car window:)SEVRAL TIMEZ IS OVERRATED"
Not What He Seems,Manly Dan,"(Gasps; furious)NOOOOO!(Veers the logging truck into the government vehicle, which goes into a spin and falls off the road into the forest)"
Not What He Seems,Trigger,"Mayday! Mayday! Agent down!(All scream, and the car crashes into the trees. Trigger gets stuck between the car and a tree branch, and struggles to get free)Darn branch!"
Not What He Seems,Mabel,"Haha, yes!(Opens the door, Dipper and Mabel leave the car)"
Not What He Seems,Trigger,Backup! Requesting backup! Ah!
Not What He Seems,Dipper,(Pulls the earpiece out of Trigger's ear and crushes it on the ground)
Not What He Seems,Mabel,"Come on, Dipper. We're gonna go clear our uncle's name."
Not What He Seems,Trigger,"Oh, you poor kids. You really think your uncle's innocent? I've seen it all before.(Mabel walks away, but Dipper pauses to listen)False names, double lives, one minute they're playing with water balloons, the next they're building doomsday devices. Your uncle scammed the whole world. You gonna let him scam you, too?"
Not What He Seems,Dipper,You(hesitates)you don't know what you're talking about.(Walks away)
Not What He Seems,Trigger,"You're gonna regret this!!(Airbag inflates, Trigger cries out, the car's horn beeps)"
Not What He Seems,Narration,"Cut to Dipper and Mabel hiding on the side of the road. Two government vehicles pass by, and as they do, Dipper and Mabel disappear from the roadside. The camera angle changes to show them hiding in the trunk of the rear car, and an arrow-shaped sign pointing in the direction they're headed that reads ""MYSTERY SHACK"". Cut to a view of the countdown, which now reads roughly five hours. Cut to Stan in the interrogation room, checking his wristwatch device."
Not What He Seems,Stan,"Only five more hours till it happens. I gottabethere! Come on, Stan, you gotta think of a way outta this.(Pounding head on table)Think! Think!"
Not What He Seems,Narration,"Suddenly the device blinks, reading ""ANOMALY IN PROGRESS."" The coffee on the table floats out of its cup, along with the cup itself and various items, then crashes back down."
Not What He Seems,Stan,"They're getting stronger. Of course, that's it!"
Not What He Seems,Narration,"Cut to the center of town, where many cars, objects, and people float off the ground and then fall back suddenly."
Not What He Seems,Tyler Cutebiker,"(ToLazy Susan:)Is it just me, or did the entire world just hiccup?"
Not What He Seems,Lazy Susan,I'm sure it's just a baby-sized earthquake.
Not What He Seems,Tyler,"Aww, baby-sized!"
Not What He Seems,Narration,"Cut to view of the laptop, which shows the countdown that Stan initiated. McGucket is in his shack, packing a bag."
Not What He Seems,McGucket,"It's happening! The End Times! When that machine activates... I gotta get outta town!(Shoving a raccoon into a bag)Get in there, raccoon wife! Git!(Runs off while a helicopter flies past overhead)"
Not What He Seems,Narration,"Cut to overhead view of the Mystery Shack, surrounded by agents. Dipper and Mabel are hiding in a bush near the Shack."
Not What He Seems,Mabel,"Alright, here's the plan. I'll take out those two guard guys, you karate chop the other dude in the neck and then we'll back flip through the front door!"
Not What He Seems,Dipper,"Mabel, aren't you forgetting the simpler solution?"
Not What He Seems,Mabel,"Oh, right."
Not What He Seems,Narration,Cut to two agents looking at the Rock that looks like a face rock.
Not What He Seems,Agent,"So is it a rock, or is it a face?"
Not What He Seems,Agent 2,"I think, it's... a metaphor."
Not What He Seems,Narration,"As they ponder,Mabel's grappling hookshoots overhead through the Shack's (now broken) window. Dipper & Mabel slide along the rope into the Shack. They dash down the stairs, avoiding detection from the agents inside the Shack, and head into Stan's office, locking the door behind them. Then they fist bump."
Not What He Seems,Dipper,"Alright. If I was Stan, where would I hide those surveillance tapes?(Looks on the bookshelf and in a filing cabinet)"
Not What He Seems,Mabel,(Seeing a bolt on the Jackalope head mounted on wall)Wait! The antelabbit!
Not What He Seems,Dipper,"Don't you mean ""jackalope?"""
Not What He Seems,Mabel,"Pfft, that can't be right.(Fixes the jackalope's bent antler, and the wall turns open to reveal two old-looking TV monitors and a tape player)"
Not What He Seems,Dipper and Mabel,Yes!
Not What He Seems,Mabel,"(Points to a tape halfway in the player)It's this week, this is it!(Pushes it in)"
Not What He Seems,Narration,"Cut to tape of Wendy, Soos, and Mabel in the Mystery Shack's gift shop, where Soos is doing the worm dance."
Not What He Seems,Mabel & Wendy,(On tape:)Go! Go! Go! Go!
Not What He Seems,Mabel,"(To Dipper:)Someone yelled ""Wormy Dance."" We had to! Fast-forward."
Not What He Seems,Narration,(Tape fast-forwards through several hours)
Not What He Seems,Dipper,Ha! There it is! Stan restocking like he said! And the date shows it was last night! It's proof! He's innocent!
Not What He Seems,Narration,"On the tape, Stan sneaks out of the shop at around 7PM."
Not What He Seems,Dipper,"(Fast forwards through till 8PM, seeing that Stan has not returned, he quickly becomes concerned)...Uhh-oh."
Not What He Seems,Mabel,"Uh, maybe he's just going to the bathroom outdoors. The way nature intended!"
Not What He Seems,Narration,"Cut back to surveillance tape. At 5AM, a figure in a haz-mat suit is wheeling barrels of radioactive waste into the gift shop. Dipper and Mabel gasp in shock and horror."
Not What He Seems,Dipper,"Ohno, Stan, you didn't..."
Not What He Seems,Mabel,Don't panic. That could be anyone in that suit!
Not What He Seems,Stan,"(On the tape, drops a barrel on his foot)GAH! HOT BELGIAN WAFFLES! Wait, I'm alone. I can swear for real!(Takes a deep breath)SON OF A--"
Not What He Seems,Dipper,"(Shuts off the tape as Mabel covers her ears)That's him, alright."
Not What He Seems,Mabel,"Okay, okay, so maybe Grunkle Stan stole some toxic waste. That doesn't mean he's leading a nefarious double life!"
Not What He Seems,Dipper,"(Pulls a box from under the TV screen)Mabel, I'm not so sure about that...(Takes a lamp from the desk and turns it on, revealing a box full of passports and IDs)"
Not What He Seems,Mabel,"(She and Dipper looking through the box)What? What is all this?(Reading from one of the IDs:)""Stetson Pinefield?"""
Not What He Seems,Dipper,"(Reading from IDs:)""Hal Forrester?"" ""Andrew '8-Ball' Alcatraz?"" These are fake IDs, Mabel! You wouldn't need these unless you were trying to hide your real identity!"
Not What He Seems,Mabel,"But why would Stan do that?(Picks a newspaper clipping out of the box, whose headline reads ""STAN PINES DEAD."" She is traumatized as she passes the clipping to Dipper)"
Not What He Seems,Dipper,"WHAT?! ""Stan PinesDead?"""
Not What He Seems,Mabel,"(Reading from article clipping:)""Foul play suspected in Pines' death."" Fiery car crash, brakes cut... by who?!"
Not What He Seems,Dipper,"(Picks out another clipping that shows a picture of Stan)""Unnamed grifter at large?"" Why would they call him unnamed? Unless Stan..."
Not What He Seems,Mabel,Isn't...
Not What He Seems,Dipper and Mabel,Stan?!(Look up at the portrait of Stan on the wall behind them)
Not What He Seems,Narration,"Cut to countdown clock, now reading under sixteen minutes."
Not What He Seems,Dipper,(Pacing)Stan Pines is dead?! Then who have we been living with? It doesn't make any sense!
Not What He Seems,Mabel,"There has to be some explanation. Maybe we're getting Ker-Prank'd! Justin Kerprank is gonna jump up from behind one of these plants(Turns to look at potted plant)any minute now!(After a brief pause she scoots forward and looks into the potted plant)...Any minute, Justin."
Not What He Seems,Dipper,I can't believe it. This whole summer I've been looking for answers and the biggest mystery was right under our nose.
Not What He Seems,Mabel,"(Digs through clippings)Ugh, there's gotta be some kind of explanation in here somewhere. What the... ""secret code to hideout?"""
Not What He Seems,Dipper,"Let me see that.(Takes outJournal 3and hisportable black light)""A1, B, C3""... I've never seen a code like this."
Not What He Seems,Mabel,"Wait! I have! Dipper, it's the vending machine!"
Not What He Seems,Narration,"Cut to Stan checking the wristwatch device, which reads about thirteen minutes now."
Not What He Seems,Powers,"(Enters interrogation room with two other agents)Alright, Pines. Playtime is over. Chopper's ready to dust off to Washington. I'll enjoy putting you away."
Not What He Seems,Stan,"What? Um, can't we stick around for maybe one minute? Uh, one minute thirty seconds?"
Not What He Seems,Powers,"We're not falling for your games, Pines. You've been running your whole life. Your time is finally up."
Not What He Seems,Stan,(Looks at a clock on the wall)Bathroom break? Just give me... fifteen seconds!
Not What He Seems,Powers,"(As he unlocks Stan's handcuffs)Sorry, but you've got a flight to catch."
Not What He Seems,Stan,"(Watch begins to beep)Oh, yeah? So do you."
Not What He Seems,Powers,Huh?
Not What He Seems,Narration,"Everything floats up from the floor. Stan kicks the table into the agents. Cut to outside the police station, where everything is losing its grip on the world. Cut back to Stan in the station."
Not What He Seems,Powers,"Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Aah!"
Not What He Seems,Narration,"Stan hits Powers with the back of his chair, turns over, thrusts away from the wall, catches the cuff key in his hands and un-cuffs himself."
Not What He Seems,Powers,"Hey! Dang it, get back here! Men, get him!"
Not What He Seems,Narration,"Stan kicks one of the agents in the chest, catches his wallet and hops from agent to agent out of the room."
Not What He Seems,Powers,No! You won't get away with this!
Not What He Seems,Narration,"Stan slams the door in Powers' face, locking it behind him. His watch beeps and gravity is working again. Behind Stan, Durland falls out of a room next door, followed by a blindfolded Blubs, swinging a bat at a piñata."
Not What He Seems,Blubs,"Gon' getcha, gon' getcha!"
Not What He Seems,Narration,The agents in the interrogation room slide to the floor with a squeaking sound.
Not What He Seems,Powers,Ow!
Not What He Seems,Narration,"Outside, everything hits the ground again, and Stan runs out of the station to a taxi."
Not What He Seems,Stan,(Panting; To taxi driver:)Do you know where the Mystery Shack is?
Not What He Seems,Taxi Driver,"Uh, yeah?"
Not What He Seems,Stan,"Okay. Here's a hundred bucks. Drive as far away from the Shack as possible, and don't stop when the cops start chasing you!"
Not What He Seems,Narration,"(The driver shrugs and speeds away, while Stan hides behind a wrecked car as the agents come out of the station.)"
Not What He Seems,Powers,"He's getting away!(Sees taxi)Obviously, follow that cab!"
Not What He Seems,Narration,Cut to Shack exterior. Trigger drives up to order the other agents.
Not What He Seems,Trigger,Stanford escaped! He's at large! We need to sweep the town!(As agents disperse from the Shack)Move! Move! Move!
Not What He Seems,Soos,"(Sneaks in to guard the vending machine)Alright Soos, remember the plan. Protect the machine, earn Stan's trust, legally get adopted by Stan, change name to Stan Junior."
Not What He Seems,Dipper,Soos?
Not What He Seems,Soos,"Ahh! Oh, kids! Where have you been?"
Not What He Seems,Dipper,What are you doing here?
Not What He Seems,Soos,Stan gave me a mission to protect this machine! Ha! And I thoughtIloved snacks.
Not What He Seems,Dipper,"Soos, listen. Something huge is going on here. If Stan is hiding some dangerous secret, we need to find out what it is! I need you to step aside."
Not What He Seems,Mabel,"Yeah, just let us through so we can prove this is all just a big misunderstanding."
Not What He Seems,Soos,"Guys, I know this seems crazy, but I promised Stan I would guard this with my life."
Not What He Seems,Mabel,"(Dipper nods at her)I'm sorry, Soos.(Blows a handful of glitter directly into Soos' face, getting it in his eyes)"
Not What He Seems,Soos,"Aah! Attack glitter! It's pretty, but it hurts!"
Not What He Seems,Dipper and Mabel,(Jump on Soos)C'mon Soos... c'mon... c'mon... please!
Not What He Seems,Soos,"(Holds them back as they try to get past)Aww, c'mon, I don't wanna fight you guys! This hurts me more than it hurts you!(As he is getting kicked in the face by Mabel)Ah! Seriously, it hurts mewaymore that it hurts you!"
Not What He Seems,Narration,"Dipper reaches for the number pad and enters the code. All shout as the vending machine swings forward, shoving them to the floor. All cough, then gasp at the secret passage behind the machine."
Not What He Seems,Soos,(Leading the way down the stairs)It's like something from a video game...
Not What He Seems,Mabel,Or a dream...
Not What He Seems,Dipper,...Or a nightmare.
Not What He Seems,Narration,"Cut to shot of Stan's feet as he races back to the Shack, cut to Soos, Dipper & Mabel heading down in the elevator, then cut back to Stan, checking the watch."
Not What He Seems,Stan,I gotta be there when it happens!(Running through the woods. Rips part of his suit on a branch)Aah!
Not What He Seems,Narration,"Cut to Soos, Dipper & Mabel entering Stan's lab. All gasp."
Not What He Seems,Mabel,"Guys, are we dreaming? Somebody wake me up."
Not What He Seems,Dipper,This can't be real...
Not What He Seems,Soos,I don't understand. Why would Mr. Pines have all this?
Not What He Seems,Dipper,It's just likethat bunker in the woods...
Not What He Seems,Soos,But what is it doing underneath the Mystery Shack?
Not What He Seems,Mabel,"Okay, okay, so he's got ahugegigantic lab. That doesn't mean anything bad! Everyone's got secrets!(Sees the picture of her and Dipper, picks it up)It's still Stan, and he loves us. And we love him. Right?"
Not What He Seems,Dipper,"It can't be... it's impossible. Theothertwo journals? All this time... all this time, Stan had them?! I can't believe it! Was anything he said to us real?!(Kicks desk in anger and frustration)Why would he have those journals?!"
Not What He Seems,Soos,Maybehe'sthe author.
Not What He Seems,Dipper,"Or maybe he stole them from the author! Maybe the reason he has all those fake IDs is because heisa master criminal, and this machine is his master plan! (Opens each journal to the page with the portal on it, lays them accordingly, and turns on his black light. Gasps)"
Not What He Seems,Mabel,Whoa.
Not What He Seems,Dipper,"(Reading from the journals:)""I was wrong the whole time. The machine was meant to create knowledge but it istoo powerful. I was deceived, and now it is too late. The device, if fully operational, couldtear our universe apart!It must not fall into the wrong hands. If the clock ever reaches zero, our universe is doomed!""(All look at the countdown clock, now reading one minute, thirty seconds)"
Not What He Seems,Soos,(panicked)It's the final countdown! Just like they always sung about!
Not What He Seems,Dipper,"(Flips through journal to a page reading ""MANUAL OVERRIDE"")The agents were right! We have to shut it down!(All enter the portal room, gasp, ground begins to shake)There! Quick! Turn these, together!(All turn three keys, a device near the center of the room pops open to reveal a large red button)That's it! The shutdown switch! This all stops... now!"
Not What He Seems,Stan,"DON'T TOUCH THAT BUTTON!!(Standing in the doorway, panting)Dipper, just back away.(Dipper's hand remains suspended inches over the button)Please don't press that shutdown button, you gotta trust me."
Not What He Seems,Dipper,And I should trust youwhy?!After you stole radioactive waste? After you lied to us all summer?! I don't even know who you are!
Not What He Seems,Stan,"Look, I know this all seems nuts, but I need that machine to stay on! If you'd just let me explain--(Wrist device beeps, ground begins to shake again)Uh-oh, oh, no! Brace yourselves!"
Not What He Seems,Narration,"They are lifted off the ground and float toward the machine. All over town, things are lifted high off the ground. Gompers ""baaa""s. Powers screams as his car flies into the air. Lazy Susan is lifted off her feet in a store.Bud Gleefulgrabs onto one of his cars as he and his customers float into the air. The sky darkens and the sun appears red over Gravity Falls."
Not What He Seems,Computer,T minus thirty-five seconds.
Not What He Seems,Stan,(Spinning in mid-air)Wh-whoa-aaaah!
Not What He Seems,Dipper,"Aaah!(Hits a wooden support, grabs on)"
Not What He Seems,Mabel,Dipper!(Ankle is hooked onto a wire over the stand the button is on)
Not What He Seems,Dipper,Mabel! Hurry! Shut it down!
Not What He Seems,Mabel,(Crawls along the wire toward the button)
Not What He Seems,Stan,"No! Mabel, Mabel, wait! Stop! Aah!(Soos knocks him away from Mabel)Soos, what're you doing?!(Furiously hits Soos on the head)I gave you an order!"
Not What He Seems,Soos,"Sorry, Mr. Pines - if that is your real name - but I have a new mission now! Protecting these kids!"
Not What He Seems,Stan,"Soos, you idiot, let me go!"
Not What He Seems,Dipper,"(Pushes off from the support beam, hits Stan and Soos)Go! Mabel, press the red button! Shut it down!"
Not What He Seems,Stan,"No, you can't!(Shoves Dipper away)You gotta trust me!"
Not What He Seems,Mabel,"Grunkle Stan,(Crying)I don't even know, if you're my grunkle! I wanna believe you, but--"
Not What He Seems,Stan,Then listen to me. Remember this morning when I said I wanted to tell you guys something?
Not What He Seems,Computer,T-minus twenty seconds.
Not What He Seems,Narration,"All scream as the portal flashes and pushes Dipper, Stan, and Soos against the opposite wall. Mabel prepares to push the button."
Not What He Seems,Stan,"I wanted to say that you're gonna hear some bad things about me, and some of them are true, but trust me. Everything I've worked for, everything I care about, it's all for this family!"
Not What He Seems,Dipper,"Mabel, what if he's lying? This thing could destroy the universe! Listen to your head!"
Not What He Seems,Stan,"Look into my eyes, Mabel! You really think I'm a bad guy?"
Not What He Seems,Dipper,He's lying! Shut it down NOW!
Not What He Seems,Stan,"Mabel, please!"
Not What He Seems,Computer,Ten. Nine.
Not What He Seems,Mabel,"(Looking away and lowering hand to the button, then looks at Stan)Grunkle Stan..."
Not What He Seems,Computer,Six. Five.
Not What He Seems,Mabel,"(Lifts hand)I trust you.(Lets go of the stand, floats up)"
Not What He Seems,Dipper,"MABEL, ARE YOU CRAZY?! WE'RE ALL GONNA-"
Not What He Seems,Computer,One.
Not What He Seems,Narration,"Dipper, Stan, Soos and Mabel all disappear in an explosion of light as each of them screams."
Not What He Seems,Dipper,NOOO-!
Not What He Seems,Stan,AAA-!
Not What He Seems,Soos,AAH-!
Not What He Seems,Mabel,AAA-!
Not What He Seems,Narration,"A flash of blinding light engulfs all of Gravity Falls. Inside, there is picture of Mabel and Dipper cracks as an unconscious bodies of Dipper and Mabel floating Then, everything comes down to earth. The portal, now a mess of tangled wires and metal, glows bright blue. A figure emerges from the portal. The blue light fades behind him. He walks forward, placing a six-fingered hand on the cover of the first journal, then picks it up and places it into the inside pocket of a long, dark coat."
Not What He Seems,Dipper,What...? Whoisthat?
Not What He Seems,Stan,The author of the journals...
Not What He Seems,Ford Pines,"(Pulls off goggles, revealing his face. He looks nearly identical to Stan)"
Not What He Seems,Stan,...my brother.

A Tale of Two Stans,Narration,The episode opens to a bird standing onGlass Shard Beach. The bird walks off as the youngStanandFord Pinesrun by.
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford Pines,Hehehehe! Wait up!
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan Pines,"Heh! Yeah, you shouldkeepup."
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,I...I can keep up!(Peeks through some boards)Whoa!

A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,"(Shines flashlight into the cave)Whoa, it's so creepy in here!"
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"(Comes into the cave)Hey, don't worry, bro. Wherever we go, we go together. Don't forget to leave our names so they know who owns the place."

A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,(Punches him in the face)
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,Oh! Ow! What the heck was that for?!
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,(Angrily)This was aninsanelyrisky move – restartingthe portal! Didn't you read my warnings?!
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"(Brushing the concerns off apathetically)Warnings, schmarnings. How's about maybe a thanks for saving you from what appears to be, I don't know, some kind of sci-fi sideburn dimension?"
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,(Furious)Thank you? You really think I'm gonnathank youafter what you DID THIRTY YEARS AGO?!
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"WhatIdid? Why, you ungrateful...(Tries to punch him but Ford ducks and grabs him)Don't expect me to go easy on you, just because you're... family.(As Ford slams him to the ground)Ah!"
A Tale of Two Stans,Mabel Pines,"Hey, hi. Mabel here. Quick question – WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON HERE?!"
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,"(Shocked)Stan, you didn't tell me there were children down here.(Points to Soos, who smiles goofily at him)And some sort of large, hairless gopher?"
A Tale of Two Stans,Soos Ramirez,Heh heh. I get that a lot.
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"They're your family, Poindexter. Shermie's grandkids."
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,(Pleasantly surprised)I-I have a niece and nephew?(Shakes Mabel's hand)Greetings. Do kids still say greetings? I haven't been in this dimension for areallylong time.
A Tale of Two Stans,Mabel,"(Amazed)Whoa, a six-fingered handshake? It's a full finger friendlier than normal!"
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,"Heha, I like this kid. She's weird."
A Tale of Two Stans,Dipper Pines,(Speechless)I-I can't believe it. You're the author ofthe journals!
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,You've read my journals?
A Tale of Two Stans,Dipper,"I haven't just read them; I'velivedthem!(Walking in circles)I've been waiting for so long to meet you, I-I don't know what to say I have so many questions- I(Starts breathing heavily)Oooooohhh I think I'm gonna throw up.(As Mabel comes over)Hmmpf! No-no, false alarm. Hmmpf! Just gotta ride it out!"
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,"Listen, there'll be time for introductions later. But first, tell me, Stan – are there any security breaches? Doesanyone elseknow about this portal?"
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"No, just us. Also maybe the entire U.S. government."
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,(Shocked and angry)TheWHAT?!
A Tale of Two Stans,Agent Powers,(Seen on security camera; to his fellow agents:)Fan out! We're not going anywhere till we find Stan Pines and those kids!
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,(Sighs)Okay. It's all right. We've got awhilebefore they findthis room. We just need to lay low andthink of a plan.
A Tale of Two Stans,Mabel,"Well, it looks like we're stuck down here for a while. Who wants to tell us their entire mysterious backstory?"
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,"Yes, I have some questions about all this myself, Stanley."
A Tale of Two Stans,Dipper,(Surprised)...Stanley?
A Tale of Two Stans,Mabel,But your name is Stanford.
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,"(Enraged)Wait, you tookmyname?! What have you been doing all these years, you knucklehead?!"
A Tale of Two Stans,Dipper,"(Sternly)Yeah, Grunkle Stan, no more lies! You owe us some answers – What's the deal with this portal? Why did you keep this a secret?"
A Tale of Two Stans,Mabel,And what happened between you and your brother?
A Tale of Two Stans,Soos,"I'm hoping all this alignsexactlywith my fanfic, Stan. If not, I will be very disappointed."
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"Okay okay okay, I know I have a lot of explaining to do. It all started... a lifetime ago... 1960-something.Glass Shard Beach, New Jersey.(Cut to a seagull landing on a sign that says ""GLASS SHARD BEACH-HOME OF GLASS SHARD WATER TOFFEE"" and coughing up a bottlecap)I lived with mymaandpain the Lead Paint District in thefamily pawn shop.(Cut to Stan's father sitting down in a chair to read a newspaper)Dad was a strict man, tough as a cinderblock and not easily impressed."
A Tale of Two Stans,Filbrick Pines,I'm not impressed.
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"Mom was a pathological liar, which served her well as a phone psychic."

A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"(Cut to Ford as a child reading in the top bunk of a bed)And then there was my nerdy twin brother, Stanford. As if his abnormally high IQ wasn't enough, he also had a rare birth defect:(Cut to an X-ray of Stanford's hands, with the extra pinkies circled and the word ""abnormality"" written above)six fingers on each hand.(Cut to Ford drawing in a notebook)Which might have explained his obsession with sci-fi mystery weirdness.(Cut to Stan as a child with a bucket on his head running into a wall)As for me, I had what mom liked to call ""personality"".(In the flashback, Stan throws the bucket off his head and the twins laugh and run off.)But as different as we were, we were the perfect team.(Cut to the twins walking around in a cave)And every day we'd wander the beach, looking for adventure.(In the flashback:)Whoooaa..."
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,"(In the flashback:)A shipwrecked sailboat, possibly haunted by pirate ghosts!"
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,This is the greatest thing I've ever seen! And I once saw a dead rat floatin' in a bucket!

A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"Huh, you know what this thing's missin'?"
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,Flags.

A Tale of Two Stans,Crampelter,"Listen, dorks, and listen good.(Points at Ford)You're a six-fingered freak(Points at Stan)and you're just a... dumber, sweatier version o' him. And you're lucky you have each other because neither of you will ever make any friends!(Leaves with his friends)Ha, hahahaha! Dorks and losers..."
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,"(Looks at his six-fingered hand, clenches it into a fist and looks upset by the people calling him a ""freak"".)"
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,Hey. Don't let those idiots get to you.
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,But Iama freak. I just wonder if there's anywhere in the world where weirdos like me fit in.
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"Hey, chin up, buddy. Look.(He and Ford look at the sea)One of these days, you and me are gonna sail away from this dumb town. We'll hunt for treasure, get all the girls, and be an unstoppable team of adventurers."
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,You really mean it?
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,High six?
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,"High six.(""High sixes"" him)"
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"(Voice-over from the present:)Those were the good times. Those bullies may have been right about us not making many friends, but when push comes to shove, you only really need one.(In the flashback, Ford is solving a math problem on a chalkboard while Stan draws a monster-like caricature of their school mistress. She hits him on the head with a ruler. Cut to the twins a few years later sitting on the boat. Cut to a few years later, when Ford is at a school dance laughing nervously at his date, who angrilly douses him with her drink. Ford looks upset, but a smile lights up to his face when Stan walks over and drenches himself with his own drink to cheer him up.)Ford's brains seemed to get more impressive every year. So did our pet project.(He and Ford are putting a sail on their boat; cut to Stan in class blowing a paper through a straw at a student next to him, then leaning over and copying off of Ford)Sure, I got in more than my fair share of trouble, but when your brother's the smartest kid in school, you've always got a leg up on the competition.(Cut to Ford winning a science fair, and then Stan comes over and puts his arm around him)The future was lookin' bright. For both of us. Till one day...(Cut to Stan eatingToffee Peanutsin class while Ford writes something)"
A Tale of Two Stans,Woman,(Over PA:)Pines twins to the principal's office. Pines twins to the principal's office.
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"(Annoyed)Ah, great, what is it this time?"
A Tale of Two Stans,Narration,Cut Ford and Stan starting to go into the principal's office. A woman at her desk stops them.
A Tale of Two Stans,Woman,(To Stan:)Not you; him.
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,(Sits in chair)Uh.
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,"(Walks into the office, sees that his parents are there and sits in the chair between them)"
A Tale of Two Stans,Principal,"Now, Mr. Pines, I'd like to speak with you very frankly if I may."
A Tale of Two Stans,Filbrick,(Bluntly)Very frankly is the only way I speak.
A Tale of Two Stans,Principal,"You have two sons: one of them is incredibly gifted, the other one is standing outside of this room and his name's Stanley."
A Tale of Two Stans,Caryn,What are you saying?
A Tale of Two Stans,Principal,"I'm saying your son, Stanford, is a GENIUS! All his teachers are going bananas over his science fair experiment!(Gives Ford a pamphlet)Ya ever heard ofWest Coast Tech? Best college in the country. Their graduates turn science fiction into sciencefact! The admissions team is visiting tomorrow to check out Stanford's experiment. Your son may be a future millionaire, Mr. Pines."
A Tale of Two Stans,Filbrick,(Smiles pleasantly)I'm impressed.
A Tale of Two Stans,Caryn,"But what about our little free spirit, Stanley?"
A Tale of Two Stans,Principal,"That clown? At this rate he'll be lucky to graduate high school. Look, there's a saltwater taffy store on the dock. And somebody's gotta get paid to scrape the barnacles off of it. Stanford's goin' places. But hey, look on the bright side: at least you'll have one son here in New Jersey forever."
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"(Sits down sadly outside the door after eavesdropping on the conversation; cut to Ford and Stan on the swings)Heh. Joke's on them if they think you wanna go to some stuffy college on the other side of the country. Once we get the Stan O' War complete, it's gonna be beaches, babes, and international treasure hunting for us."
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,"Look, Stan, I can't pass up a chance like this. This school has cutting edge programs and multi-dimensional paradigm theory."
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,Beep boop. I am a nerd robot. That's you. That's what you sound like.
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,"Heheh. Ah, well, if the college board isn't impressed with my experiment tomorrow, then okay, I'll do the treasure-hunting thing."
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,And if they are?
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,"(Punches him playfully in the arm)Well then, I guess you better come visit me on the other side of thecountry. Haha.(Walks away back home)"
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"(Voice-over from the present:)Without Ford, I was just half of a dynamic duo. I couldn't make it without him.(Cut to Stan walking through the science experiments at the school's gymnasium during the night.)And now, thanks to that dumb college, I was gonna lose my brother forever.(In the flashback, Stan stops at Ford's experiment as he then furiously throws his bag of Toffee Peanuts on the floor and points at it:)This is allyourfault, ya dumb machine!(Slams his fist on the table, causing the experiment to briefly stumble backwards from the impact and receive some damage upon reconnecting with the table. In addition, the grate covering the hole leading into its inner workings is dislodged as smoke then comes out of there)Oh no. Oh no, no, what did I do?(Reattaches the dislodged grate)There. Alright. Good as new. Probably.(Places a tarp over the experiment in an attempt to cover his tracks and leaves; cut to Ford in front of the tarp the next morning with the college board)"
A Tale of Two Stans,Lead Board Member,"Alright, kid. Show us what ya got."
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,"Okay! Well, what would you say if I told you the future of technology was beneath this sheet?(Pulls the tarp off)"
A Tale of Two Stans,Lead Board Member,(Stoically)I'd say we wasted a car trip.
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,"What?!(Looks at his experiment, which is now inoperable)But it was stable yesterday! A fuse must have blown or something."
A Tale of Two Stans,Lead Board Member,"(As he crosses ""Stanford Pines"" off of a list of names)Kid, a perpetual motion machine has one job – to not stop. I don't think you're West Coast Tech material.(Leads the other college board members away)"
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,"No, wait! Don't go! I worked so hard!(Steps on Stan's discarded bag of Toffee Peanuts, picks it up and looks shocked. Realizing that Stan was here the night before and believing he sabotaged his experiment, Ford furiously crushes the bag and growls.)"
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"(Cut to their house; he is sitting on its living room's couch playing with a paddleball while watching TV)One-paddle-paddle-paddle, two-paddle-paddle. Man, thatJackie-O, what a fox.(Ford enters and furiously confronts Stan.)Hey, what's the word, Sixer?"
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,(Holds up the bag)Can you explain whatthiswas doing next to my broken project?!
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"Ho-okay. I might have accidentally been, horsing around-"
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,"This was no accident, Stan;youdid this! You did this because you couldn't handle me going to college on my own!"
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"Look, it was a mistake! Although if you think about it, maybe there's a silver lining. Huh? Treasure hunting?"
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,Are you kidding me? Why would I want to do anything with the person who sabotaged my entirefuture?!(Shoves Stan onto the couch in disgust.)
A Tale of Two Stans,Filbrick,"(Comes in and picks up Stan by his shirt as he glares at him suspiciously)You didwhat, you knucklehead?"
A Tale of Two Stans,Caryn,(Comes out of a room with a crying baby)Stanley? What's goin' on in here?
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"Wait, no, I can explain; it was a mistake!"
A Tale of Two Stans,Filbrick,"(Throws Stan outside)You ignoramus! Your brother was gonna be our ticket out of this dump! All you ever do is lie and cheat, and ride on your brother's coattails. Well, this time, you cost our family potentialmillions! And untilyoumake us a fortune,you're not welcome in this household!(Throws a duffel bag at him)"
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"What?! Stanford, tell him he's bein' crazy!(Ford, who is watching out his window, looks slightly regretful to see his brother's predicament. When he looks at the West Coast Tech pamphlet their family was given the day before, Ford closes his curtains.)Stanford? Don't leave me hangin'. High six?(Filbrick slams the pawn shop's front door in his son's face. Stan looks sad, but then hardens his look.)Fine! I can make it on my own! I don't need you! I don't need anyone! I'll make millions and you'llruethe day you turned your back on me!(Gets inhis carand drives away; voice-over from the present:)Thanks to one dumb mistake I had no brother, no home, no nothing. But I had a plan to fix everything."
A Tale of Two Stans,Narration,Cut back to the present.
A Tale of Two Stans,Mabel,Oh! This story's so sad! I know what you two little broken teacups need: to hug it out! Hug it out! Hug train's comin' in the station. HUGAPOLOOZA! 2000!
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"Kid, will ya knock that off? I'm tryin' to tell my life story here.(Cut to Stan as a young man with a metal detector on the beach)I had decided I wasn't gonna show my face at home until I proved I could make something of myself. Unfortunately, the treasure-hunting business was slow going. Apparently gold is some kind of... rare metal.(In the flashback, Stan sees a billboard advertising the traveling salesman lifestyle and throws his metal detector away)Luckily I struck another kind of gold... insales. (Cut to Stan in a commercial; in commercial:)Hi there! I'm Stan Pines of Stan Co. Enterprises. Are you sick ofthisalways happening toyou?(A pitcher of juice is thrown at him, getting juice all over him)Then you need the Shammy of the future!(Begins to wipe himself off, then the commercial skips ahead to him completely clean)Made with the same material astronauts use to clean up cranberry stains on the moon! That's the Sham Total!(Wrings out the Shammy)It's a total sham.(Voice-over from the present:)I had made my mark, alright. Unfortunately, so did the Shammies.(Cut to a woman using a Sham Total to clean a robe, but the blue dye from the Shammy leaks onto it and her hands.)Apparently the cheap dye I used to color them only made stains worse.(Cut to an angry mob)Customers weren't crazy about that. Luckily, they were chasing me with Stan Co. brand pitchforks.(The mob's pitchforks break; Stanley drives by them in his car; in flashback:)SUCKERS!(Voice-over from present:)I was officially banned from New Jersey, but with a quick name change, Steve Pinington was ready to take on Pennsylvania.(In another commercial:)Hi! I'm Steve Pinington!(Pulls at Band-aid on his arm)Are you sick of bandages that are hard to remove? Then what you need is the Rip Off! The Rip Offwon'tgive you rashes, I repeat – itwon'tgive you rashes.(The words ""IT WON'T GIVE YOU RASHES"" appears on the screen; voice-over from present as another angry mob chases Stanley out of Pennsylvania:)It gave ya rashes.(Cut to a map of North America with a line moving around it)I traveled the whole country, sometimes outside of it, always one step ahead of the law, looking for something that would be my big break."
A Tale of Two Stans,Narration,Cut back to the present.
A Tale of Two Stans,Mabel,Whoa. So that explains all the fake IDs.
A Tale of Two Stans,Dipper,"(To Ford:)But wait, what about you? Did you end up going to your dream school?"
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,"Not exactly.(Cut back to the past, on the auditorium of Backupsmore University)"
A Tale of Two Stans,Speaker,"(Standing at podium)Alright, I know Backupsmore wasn't anyone's first choice, but what we lack in prestige, we make up for inmostly bug-free dorms! I'm sure your families are proud, more or less."
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,"(Sitting in the audience, looks at a picture of his family; cut to him studying in his dorm; voice-over from the present:)In a place like that, I had to work twice as hard. Luckily, that's what I do best. I went from undergrad to PhD three years ahead of schedule, wrote a thesis that was nationally ranked and was awarded an enormous grant for my own scientific research! But what to study?(Cut to Ford looking at his hand, then at a book about anomalies)My whole life, I'd been teased for my six fingers, but that got my thinking about anomalies – things that were odd, unusual, statistically improbable. And according to my investigations, there was one place with a higher concentration of these things than anywhere else.(Cut to Ford standing in front of a map of North America with dots marked on it, most of which are in Oregon. Ford circles Oregon)A small lumber town in Roadkill County, Oregon –Gravity Falls."
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"(in a flashback, marks Xs on a map of USA with ""STATES I'M BANNED IN"" written above it; Voice-over from present:)Meanwhile, your old uncle Stan was doing great. I had come up with a sophisticated new business strategy.(In the flashback, picks up a lottery card and begins scratching some circles off with a coin, in flashback:)Come on, owl...(scratches another owl)owl...(Scratches a football player with an omelet)football player with an omelet!? Gah!(Crumples the card up and throws it against the window; voice-over from present:)I was in great shape, living on my own and the best part was I didn't need help from nobody.(Cut to him in the flashback dialing a number at a payphone)"
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,"(In flashback, over phone:)Hello? This is Stanford Pines."
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,(Hangs up phone and sighs)
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,"(Driving into Gravity Falls; voice-over from the present:)I was heading out on my own as well.(Standing in front of the Mystery Shack being constructed)I set to work using my grant money to investigate the strange properties of this town, but what would I find here?(A giant hand grabs his car)Bingo. I began to investigate at once.(Cut to him setting a Journal on a table, tracing his hand, pasting the trace on the Journal, and writing ""1"" on it)I knew I'd have to record my findings. I began to keep a journal..."
A Tale of Two Stans,Dipper,(Screams)THE JOURNALS!!!
A Tale of Two Stans,Narration,Cut back to the present. Everyone is staring at Dipper.
A Tale of Two Stans,Dipper,"Sorry, sorry,(Clears throat)just got excited there... About the journals... Keep-keep talking."
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,I began to keep a journal...
A Tale of Two Stans,Dipper,(Screams)
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,"(Clears his throat) Just going to ignore that. There were anomalies everywhere. And the more I looked, the more I saw.(Cut to him as a young man catchingEye-Batsand putting them into a jar, then recording it in his Journal; theShape Shifterhatches in front of him, then immediately turns into a cup. Stanford writes in his journal about the ""floating cliffs"". Cut to him and agnomethat looks like Shmebulock; in flashback:)Fascinating, what did you say your name was?"
A Tale of Two Stans,Gnome,Shmebulock... Senior.
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,"(Writes injournal 3and looks at cover; voice-over from present:)It was finally a place where I felt at home, but something nagged at me: where did it all come from? It seemed to me the answer must come from outside of our world, a dimension of weirdness leaking into ours. I realized the only way to understand Gravity Falls would be to build a gateway: a portal to the source of its weirdness.(In the flashback, is drawing the portal map in the journals)But I couldn't make it alone. I decided to call up my old college buddy,Fiddleford McGucket, a young but brilliant mechanic, who was wasting his talent trying to make personal computers in some garage inPalo Alto.(Cut to McGucket's garage full of computers, where he is playing a banjo when the phone rings. He picks it up)"
A Tale of Two Stans,McGucket,Hello? Fiddleford Computermajigs? You say you're tryin' to build a transuniversal polydimensional metavortex? Well that's mathematically feasible! I reckon.(Spits)
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,"(Cut to Ford and McGucket working on the portal, when the power surges)Many long nights were spent perfecting the machine. It would be a crowning achievement of my studies. An answer to the source of this town's anomalies."
A Tale of Two Stans,Tyler's mother,"(ToTyler Cutebiker, who is on a bike:)Git out, git out, git out!(The two hurriedly leave the area)"
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,"(He and McGucket carry a dummy to the portal)The time had come to test it.(In flashback:)Ready, and...(They release the dummy, but a rope from it catches McGucket and he flies toward the portal, screaming)What?(Grabs the rope and holds him, back but McGucket's head is in the portal)I got ya, buddy!(pulls the rope and McGucket and the dummy come out of the portal; to McGucket:)What is it? Is it working? What did you see?!"
A Tale of Two Stans,McGucket,Ahh! VOTMZRIGIVSKRX OORY.
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,Fiddleford?
A Tale of Two Stans,McGucket,"When gravity falls and earth becomes sky, fear the beast with just one eye."
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,"Fiddleford, get a hold of yourself, you're not making any sense.(Puts his hand on McGucket's shoulder)"
A Tale of Two Stans,McGucket,(Jerks away)This machine is dangerous. You'll bring about the end of the world with this. Destroy it before it destroys us all!
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,I can'tdestroythis; it's my life's work!
A Tale of Two Stans,McGucket,I fear we've unleashed a grave danger on the world. OneI'd just as soon forget. I quit!(Walks away)
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,"Fine! I'll do it without you! I don't need you! I don't need anyone!(A whispering sound is heard)What? Who said that?(Backs into a wall; voice-over from the present:)I was in over my head, and feared I was losing my sanity. I needed help. Someone I could trust."
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"(Cut to him in a motel room when he hears knocking. Grabs baseball bat)Just give me a few more days, Rico! I'll pay your goons back, I swear!(A Gravity Falls postcard comes through his mail slot. He looks out and sees the post man leaving. He looks at the postcard which says ""PLEASE COME! -FORD.

A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,(Opens door)WHO IS IT?! Have you come to steal my eyes?!?!(Points crossbow)
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"...Well, I can always count on you for a warm welcome."
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,"Stanley, did anyone follow you? Anyone at all?"
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"Eh, hello to you, too, pal.(As Ford grabs him and pulls him inside)Ah!"
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,(Shines flashlight in Stan's eyes)
A Tale of Two Stans,Stanley,(Pushes him away)Ah! Hey! What is this?
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,"Sorry, I just had to make sure you weren't... uh, it's nothing. Come in, come in.(Darts away)"
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"(Following him)Uh, you gonna explain what's going on, here? You're acting like Mom after her tenth cup of coffee."
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,"(Holding Journal 1)Listen, there isn't much time. I've madehugemistakes and I don't know who I can trust anymore.(Turns the head of a skeleton away from him)"
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"Hey, uh, easy there. Let's talk this through, okay?"
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,I have something to show you. Something you won't believe.
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"Look, I've been around the world, okay? Whatever it is, I'll understand.(Standing in the portal room)There isnothingabout this I understand."
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,"It's a trans-universal gateway, a punched hole through a weak spot in our dimension. I created it to unlock the mysteries of the universe. But it could just as easily be harnessed for terrible destruction. That's why I shut it down and hid my journals, which explain how to operate it. There's only one journal left. And you are theonlyperson I can trust to take it.(Gives Stan the journal)I have something to ask of you: remember our plans to sail around the world on a boat?(Stan smiles.)Take this book, get on a boat, and sail as far away as ya can! To the edge of the Earth! Bury it where no one can find it!"
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,(Gets an angry look on his face) That'sit?! You finally wanna see me after ten years and it's to tell me to get as far away from you as possible!?
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,"Stanley, you don't understand what I'm up against! What I've been through!"
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"No, no. You don't understand whatI'vebeen through! I've been to prison in three different countries! I once had to chew my way out of thetrunk of a car! You thinkyou'vegot problems? I've got amullet,Stanford! Meanwhile, where have you been? Living it up in your fancy house in the woods! Selfishly hoarding your college money, because you only care about yourself!"
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,"I'mselfish?I'mselfish, Stanley? How can yousaythat after costing me my dream school?! I'm giving you a chance to do the first worthwhile thing in your life and you won't even listen!"
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"Well, listen to this – you want me to get rid of this book? Fine, I'll get rid of it right now! (Takes out a lighter and lights it, intent on burning the journal)"
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,No!(Grabs the journal)You don't understand!
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"(Takes it back)You said you wanted me to have it, so I'll do what I want with it! (Holds the journal over the lighter's flame)"
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,"My research!(Tackles Stan, then runs for the journal, but Stan trips him. Ford runs after him as Stan picks up the journal)Stanley, give it back!(Pushes him onto some of the buttons)"
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"You want it back, you're gonna have to try harder than that!"
A Tale of Two Stans,Narration,The portal is activated.
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"(Trying to pull the journal away from Ford)You left me behind, you jerk! It was supposed to be us forever, you ruined my life!"
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,"You ruined your own life!(Kicks him into the side of the control panel, brandingthe symbol onto his back. Stan screams in pain and falls to the floor)Stanley! Oh my gosh! I'm so sorry! Are you alr-"
A Tale of Two Stans,Narration,"Stan punches Ford, who stumbles backward and trips over the lever, fully activating the portal. Stan walks toward him while holding his shoulder due to the branding."
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"Some brotheryouturned out to be. You care more about your dumb mysteries than your family? Well, then YOU CAN HAVE 'EM!(Shoves Ford back into the portal light, and he starts getting sucked into it)Whoa, whoa, hey, what's going on? Hey, hey, Stanford-"
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,"Stanley! Stanley, help me!"
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"Oh, no, what do I do?!!"
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,Stanley! Stanley! Do something! STANLEY!(Throws Journal 1 at Stan and disappears into the portal)
A Tale of Two Stans,Narration,"A flash of white engulfs everything. When it fades, Stan is lying on the floor."
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,Stanford?
A Tale of Two Stans,Narration,Ford's glasses fall onto the floor.
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"(Runs to the portal)Stanford, come back! I DIDN'T MEAN IT!(Pounds on the portal's gateway)"
A Tale of Two Stans,Narration,The portal shuts down after having depleted the remainder of its supplied fuel.
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"(Runs to the lever and tries to pull it to no avail)I just got him back! I can't lose him again! Ah, come on! STANFORD!(Echoes into the portal; voice-over from the present:)I lost him. I didn't know if he was dead or alive in some distant galaxy, but I knew his journal must have the answer to getting him back. Somehow.(Flips to the back of Journal 1, where it says ""continued injournal #2""; cut to Stan laying on the couch with Journal 1 and Ford's glasses at night)I didn't get much sleep that night.(Looks at the glasses)Or the night after that. (Sighs sadly)(Cut to Stan with the lever and a screwdriver, making adjustments)I tried for weeks to turn that dumb machine back on. (Stan pulls the lever) But without the other two journals(The machine emits a few sparks, then dies)it was hopeless.(Cut to Stan walking down the street)Finally I ran out of food. (Pulls his hood over his head) I had no choice but to go into town.(Walks into theDusk 2 Dawn, this wasback when it was still openandsome teenagerswere dancing outside; cut to him with a loaf of bread at the cash register)"
A Tale of Two Stans,Ma,"Just the bread, then, there, stranger? That'll be 99 cents."
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"(Looks into his pockets and pulls out a packet of sugar, a paper clip and a peso)"
A Tale of Two Stans,Susan,"Hey, that's no stranger. That must be the mysterious science guy that lives in the woods!"
A Tale of Two Stans,Narration,A crowd gathers.
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"(In flashback:)Uh, n-no, no. You've got the wrong guy.(Pulls his hood tighter)"
A Tale of Two Stans,Toby Determined,I've heard strange stories about that old shack.
A Tale of Two Stans,Daryl Blubs,Yeah! Mysterious lights and spooky experiments.
A Tale of Two Stans,Pa,"Gosh, I'd pay anything to see what kind of shenanigans you get up to in there."
A Tale of Two Stans,Susan,"Oh, me too! Do you ever give tours?"
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"No. Really I-(Looks at the items in his hand, closes his hand, then sighs)Yes, Idogive tours! Ten... no-no... fifteen bucks a person!"
A Tale of Two Stans,Narration,Crowd cheers and holds up money.
A Tale of Two Stans,Susan,"So, what did you say your name was, you man of mystery?"
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"Oh, uh, Stan...ford.(Thinks for a moment)Stanford Pines.(Cut to Stan leading a tour into the house)Step right up, folks, uh, to a world of... enchantment, or whatever.(With a box with a dial and two antennae on it)Behold, the um, nerdy science box."
A Tale of Two Stans,Susan,(Looks at it and it zaps her eye)Ah! My eye!
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"Uh, I can assure you, that is in no way permanent."
A Tale of Two Stans,Susan,I paid fifteen dollars for this!?
A Tale of Two Stans,Narration,Crowd begins muttering.
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"Uhh...(Grabs the skeleton and some clothing)You're lucky you weren't part of the last tour group, um,(Shows them the skeleton, which he has dressed as a tourist)they never made it out aliiiivve. Heheh. Right?"
A Tale of Two Stans,Narration,The crowd laughs.
A Tale of Two Stans,Susan,That's funny.
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"(Montage of Stan putting up signs, making attractions, selling merchandise, with the cabin gradually turning into the Mystery Shack it is today. Voice-over from the present:)So I came up with a plan. I couldn't leave my brother's house until I figured out how to save him, but I needed to pay his mortgage somehow. For once in my life, people were actually buying what I was selling. And so the Murder Hut was born! Later renamed the Mystery Shack. Finally I'd found something I was good at. For once being a liar and a cheat paid off. The old me was dead, and I faked a car crash to prove it. By day I was Stanford Pines: Mr. Mystery. But by night I was down in the basement, trying to bring the real Stanford back.(Cut to Stan seeing a tour out, then going into thebasementand looking at the portal. Cut back to the present)I couldn't risk anyone learning the truth and sabotaging my mission, so I lied to everyone: the town, my family, yourparents, even you kids."
A Tale of Two Stans,Dipper,"So all this time you were just trying to save your brother. Grunkle Stan, I'm so sorry I didn't believe you."
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"That's okay, kid. I probably wouldn't have believed me either."
A Tale of Two Stans,Agent,(From upstairs:)I heard talking! It was coming from downstairs!
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"Oh no, it's too late, the agents are comin' for us!"
A Tale of Two Stans,Mabel,What do we do?!
A Tale of Two Stans,Soos,"Aw, man. I was so spellbound by your dramatic tale I forgot all about those dudes."
A Tale of Two Stans,Dipper,"Wait, forget. That's it! I think I know a way we might be able to defeat those agents!(Takes aMemory erasing gunout of a bag and gives it to Stanford)"
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,"Of course! I don't know how you got a hold of one of these but, this is perfect! If I can just amplify the signal to a radio headset frequency...(Plugs some wires into the gun and looks through some viewing glasses to see the agents running into the shack)There. Now everyone PLUG YOUR EARS! GET DOWN! NOW!"
A Tale of Two Stans,Narration,Everyone crouches and plugs their ears. Cut to Agent Powers and Trigger at the doorway.
A Tale of Two Stans,Agent Trigger,Sir! Looks like there's a hidden door behind thevending machine!
A Tale of Two Stans,Powers,"Excellent! Get me Washington on Line 1! I've been practicing making sounds of excitement for this very occasion. Hey, do you hear that?"
A Tale of Two Stans,Narration,A wave pulses through the shack and yard.
A Tale of Two Stans,Powers,What? Where am I? Why am I standing in front of some sort of goofy fun knick-knack house?
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,"(Comes to the porch)Stand down, gentlemen! I've been sent with the latest intel from Washington.(flipping through some of Mabel's drawings)According to this very real report, the power surges in Gravity Falls were actually due to radiation from an unreported meteor shower. A total embarrassment for your whole department. Luckily I'm here to take this mess off your hands, but I'll need of all your... floppy disks, and 8-tracks...right?"
A Tale of Two Stans,Powers,"Uh, everything about this case is contained on this drive."
A Tale of Two Stans,Trigger,"(Hands Ford a flash drive labeled ""PINES"")"
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,"Well, what are you waiting for, a kiss on the cheek? Get out of here before I have your butts court-martialed!"
A Tale of Two Stans,Powers,"Uhh, yes sir. Apologies, sir.(whistles)False alarm, everyone!(Trips on his way back to thecar)"
A Tale of Two Stans,Narration,"The government agents all leave. Ford givesGompersthe flash drive, and the goat runs away with it in his mouth."
A Tale of Two Stans,Mabel,"(Runs out with Dipper)Great-uncle Stanford, that was amazing!"
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,(Follows with Soos)Let's not go crazy; it was serviceable.
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,"(Chuckles)Thank you, kids, but please, call me Ford."
A Tale of Two Stans,Dipper,"Sure! Thanks, Great-uncle Ford. So, uh,(Holds up a pen and notepad and clicks pen excitedly)would you mind if I ask you a couple billion questions about Gravity Falls?"
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,"Um, well I-uh..."
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"All right, kids, it's been a long day and me and my brother have a lot to talk about. So why don't you hit the hay, huh?"
A Tale of Two Stans,Dipper,"But, it's the author!(Clicks pen rapidly)I've been waiting so long to ask questions about-"
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,(Grabs Dipper and Mabel's heads and pushes them away)I said. Hit. The hay!
A Tale of Two Stans,Soos,"I'll just... let myself out.(Sidesteps away, and when he's out of sight the beeping of a phone can be heard; Offscreen:)Wendy, I've got something amazing to tell you. Clear the next fourteen hours!"
A Tale of Two Stans,Narration,Cut to night. Stan and Ford are looking at themselves in the mirror.
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,Look at us. When did we become old men?
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,You look like Dad.
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"Ugh, uck, don'tsaythat."
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford and Stan,(Laugh)
A Tale of Two Stans,Ford,"(Sighs)Okay, Stanley, here's the deal. You can stay here for the summer to watch the kids. I'll stay down in the basement and try tocontain any remaining damage. But when the summer's over, you give me my house back, you give me mynameback, and this Mystery Shack junk is over forever. You got it?"
A Tale of Two Stans,Stan,"You really aren't gonna thank me, are you?(Beat)Fine. On one condition: you stay away from the kids; I don't want them in danger. Cause as far as I'm concerned, they're the only family I have left.(Walks upstairs, leaving Ford to look down bitterly, yet Ford was genuinely saddened and hurt by his twin's words. Stan stops, looks back at his brother sadly, then keeps walking)"
A Tale of Two Stans,Narration,Cut to Dipper and Mabel in their room. Mabel is standing by the door.
A Tale of Two Stans,Mabel,"Did you hear what they said? I think Grunkle Ford said they're gonna buy us puppies made of ice cream. Might be wishful thinking, though."
A Tale of Two Stans,Dipper,"I don't know if this is good or bad. I wanted to meet the author, but..."
A Tale of Two Stans,Mabel,(Sits on her bed)Yeah. I liked the way things were here before. Just us and Stan and the occasional goblin-monster.
A Tale of Two Stans,Dipper,"Eh, I'm sure they'll work things out."
A Tale of Two Stans,Mabel,"Dipper, you don't think we'll turn out like Stan and Ford, do you?"
A Tale of Two Stans,Dipper,Well. What do you mean?
A Tale of Two Stans,Mabel,"(Lays down)I mean, they used to be best friends, but then they got all stupid. Can you promise me you won't get stupid?"
A Tale of Two Stans,Dipper,"Not stupider than you, dum-dum."
A Tale of Two Stans,Mabel,"(Laughs)Good night, stupid."
A Tale of Two Stans,Dipper,"Good night, stupid.(Turns light off and closes eyes)"
A Tale of Two Stans,Mabel,(Looks up nervously)
A Tale of Two Stans,Narration,End credits: Wendy is sitting up in her bed at 3 in the morning with Soos on the phone.
A Tale of Two Stans,Soos,"Okay, okay, so it turns out that the second Stan, the Stan that we know, was actually Stanley, but the first Stan was Stanford, but we didn't know, until that Stanford came out of the portal, which was built by Stanford, but then Stanley pretending to be Stanford, he did the portal, cause he's Stan, but he'snotStan."
A Tale of Two Stans,Wendy Corduroy,"Soos, it's three in the morning."
A Tale of Two Stans,Soos,"Okay, okay, I understand. Anyway, act two: Stan started..."

"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Mabel Pines,"(Blows bag ofCheese Boodlesinto the air, bag slowly drifts down)I just ate a bag of Cheese Boodles without using my hands. Lazy Tuesday, you are delivering in abigway!"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Stan Pines,Heh. Yeah. It's nice to finally have a day where nothing interesting happens whatsoever.
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Ford Pines,(Comes out of thevending machinedoor with aCycloptopuson his wrist)
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Mabel andDipper Pines,(Scream)
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Ford,"Everyone, get down! Don't let it taste human flesh!(Punches it and it drops off his hand crawls around the room)"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Dipper,What is it?!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Mabel,Can we keep it?
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Stan,(hitting it with a rolled up newspaper)Kill it! Kill it!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Ford,(Chases it into the corner)Patience... and(When the cycloptopus' eye turns into a screaming mouth)Gotcha!(Shocks it with his gloves and holds up its burnt body)
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Stan,Great. Now get it outta here. It smells like if death could barf.
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Dipper,"(Runs over to Ford withJournal 2)Great-uncle Ford! You need any help with that? I've read all about these creatures in your journal, and I think I know how to--"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Ford,"No! I'm sorry, Dipper. On the dark, weird road I travel, I'm afraid you cannot follow. Well, call me for dinner!(Closes the vending machine door behind him)"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Dipper,Maybe next time then? Or not? Or never.
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Mabel,"Aww, Dipper, don't take it so hard."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Stan,"(Hits Dipper with newspaper)No,dotake it hard. Take it hard and serious. My brother is a dangerous know-it-all, and the stuff he's messing with is even worse. Do yourself a favor and stay away from him, you hear me?"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Dipper,"But, Grunkle Stan, all summer long I've wanted to know who the author of the journal was. Now the guy lives in our basement and I can't even talk to him."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Stan,Don't worry about what's in the basement. You belong up here with me and Mabel.
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Mabel,"Yeah! Besides, the season finale ofDuck-tectiveis airing this Friday! That's all the mystery you needthisweek. Come on, quack with us, Dipper! Quack, quack quack quack..."

Just yesterday gravity reversed itself, almost destroying the universe andtotallywrecking the whole town!(Looks up at TV, whereLazy Susanis standing in front of a crane attempting to pick upGreasy's Diner)"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Lazy Susan,"Well, they say it was an earthquake, but you know what I think? I think I'm gonna have to start serving pineapple right-side up cake! Haha! Am I right?AmI right?(Greasy's Diner falls down from the crane)"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Narration,Cut toMayor Befufftlefumpteron a stage in front of the town.

And they areadorabletogether!(Stops writing, takes the picture of Stan and Ford holding hands she has drawn on the letter and folds them together; high voice:)We love each other so much!(makes kissing noises)"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Dipper,(Runs in with a box)Mabel! You'll never guess what I found at the store today!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Mabel,Dogs! Dogs with hats!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Dipper,"No, it's my favorite fantasy-talking, level-counting, statistics and graph paper-involving game of all time:(Holds it up)Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons!You wanna play it with me?"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Mabel,"Well, I do likeunicorns, and thathot elflooks promising. How do you play?"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Dipper,"The rules are simple.(Opens game book)First, you roll a 38-sided die to determine the level of each player's statistical analysis power orb. These orbs relate directly to the amount(Mabel's eager smile turns into a skeptical frown)of quadrants that your team has dominion over, which isinverseto the anti-quadrants in your quadrant satchel."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Mabel,Andthenwe ride unicorns?
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Dipper,Yes!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Mabel,(Gasps happily)
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Dipper,And no.
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Mabel,(Frowns annoyed)
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Dipper,"First, we make a graph.(Holds up graph paper)"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Mabel,"(Groans)This is like ""Homework: The Game""."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Dipper,"Come on, Mabel, I need at least two people to play."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Soos Ramirez,(Walks in)
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Mabel,"Oh, wow, would you look at that: two people!(Backs out)"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Dipper,"Huh. Hey, Soos, up for a little game of D&D&MoreD?"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Soos,"Aw, sorry, Dipper, I don't go in for that pen and paper kind of stuff. I'm more of an FCLORPer."

"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Deputy Durland,I'm a fortress!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Narration,Cut back to the present.
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Dipper,"Well, thanks anyway, Soos."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Stan,"(Walks in)Say, is this that game that's mostly math and writing and isn't anything like the picture on the box?"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Dipper,"Yes! It is! You wanna play with me, Grunkle Stan?"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Stan,"Ha! Look, kid, I prefer to do my dice rolling in Vegas. Besides, only a game designed by nerds would have ""charisma"" as a fantasy power. Heh. Check this out:(Reading from book:)When facing yon adversaries, shield thyself, under an elfin buttress."

"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Ford,Dipper! Stop!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Dipper,Great-uncle Ford!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Ford,"What did I say about coming down here? My work is far too dangerous for a single living soul to spend even one second i- wait! Is that a 38-sided die fromDungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons?!"

"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Ford,This is my favorite game in the whole multiverse! I can't believe they still make it!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Dipper,They do! And I've been looking all day for someone to play it with me!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Ford,"My boy, do you know what this means? We must stop everything I've been working on at once... and PLAY!(Dipper is ecstatic)"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Cycloptopus,(Grabs Ford's face)
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Ford,(Pulls it off; his face is covered in welts)That's... going to leave a mark.
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Narration,Commercial break. Cut to Mabel and Stan in the kitchen.
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Mabel,Okay. We've got everything we need to watch the season finale of Duck-tective tomorrow.(Holds up a box full of food with a ramp)I even made mouth-ramps so we can pour food into our mouths without taking our eyes off the screen.(Pours some food into her mouth)Nom nom nom.
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Stan,(Stapling a turkey head to a beaver's body)And I recreated the main character out of some spare taxidermy parts.(Imitating Duck-tective:)Quack quack. I'm the duck detective! Who stole my breadloaf?
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Mabel,Hahaha! That is so messed up! Dipper would LOVE that!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Stan,Heh. Yeah. Where is the little squirt anyway? I haven't seen him all afternoon.
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Narration,Cut to the basement.
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Ford,(Moving the dice around his fingers)Alright. You've entered the chamber. Princess Unatainabelle beckons you. But WAIT! IT'S A TRAP!

"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Dipper and Ford,Prime-statistical anomalies over 37 but not exceeding 51!(Roll the dice)
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Dipper,"Yes! Uh! In your face, you cardboard wizard!"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Ford,(Holds up the picture of Probabilitor)Hm. The old boy looks a bit different than he did back in my day.
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Dipper,"Mmm, yeah, they change the art every few years. Thankfully you missed the period when the creators of the game tried to make it ""cooler."""
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Narration,"Cut to an old commercial. Some teenagers spray paint over an advertisement for Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Teen,"Man, this game isboring."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Narration,"The wall explodes and Probabilitor, wearing colorful clothing, appears."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Probabilitor,You dare challenge Probabilitizle!?(dances with the teens)
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Voice over,"(Rapping:)I flip the cap back, and roll the dice. Don't step to the wizard cause the wizard don't..."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Narration,"The words ""Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons"" appears, then is crossed out and replaced by ""Diggity Dungeons & All That."""

"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Dipper,"(shivers)Must have been dark times, those '90s."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Ford,Yeesh. Sounds like a good time to be stuck between dimensions.
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Dipper,"Great-uncle Ford, I've been meaning to ask you: where were you before you came out of that machine, and what have you been doing down here? Are you working on something behind that curtain?"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Ford,"Dipper, it's best if you and the family stay away from that subject. Honestly, I'm not sure any of you could handle the real answer."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Dipper,"But, but I can handle it-"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Ford,"Ah-ah! But I can show you a little something I brought back with me:(Dumps out the contents of his bag and opens a box, revealing a die with interchanging sides and symbols)Aninfinity-sided die."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Dipper,Woah... that'ssocool. And... impossible!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Ford,"These things are outlawed in nine thousand dimensions. You wanna know why? Look at those symbols. Infinite sides means infinite outcomes. If I rolled it, anything could happen. Our faces could melt into jelly. The world could turn into an egg. Or you could just roll an eight. Who knows. That's why I have to keep it in this protective cheap plastic case. Now, back to the game! You've got Probabilitor on the ropes."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Narration,Cut to the attic at night. Mabel is trying to sleep while Dipper is writing on graph paper on the floor.
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Dipper,"Hohoho man. And then, if I had a dragon here, and then a plus three fire mode-"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Mabel,"Dipper, are you going to go to sleep? You've been saying dork words for hours."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Dipper,"Sorry, Mabel, Igotto finish this dungeon. It's gonnatotallystump Great-uncle Ford tomorrow, I can't wait to see the look on his face."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Mabel,"You're uh, spending a lot of time with old Fordsy lately, huh?"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Dipper,"You have no idea. I knew the author must be cool, but he's better than I imagined. And, he doesn't make fun of me all the time, the way you and Grunkle Stan do."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Mabel,"Give 'im time, haha! Heyooo!(Pause)Nah, you got me.(Lays down; to herself upset:)You got me."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Narration,Cut to Mabel and Grenda at the doorway the next day.
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Mabel,"(Puts on a Duck-tective sweater, to Grenda:)Thanks for coming over to watch tonight's Duck-tective finale, Grenda!"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Grenda Grendinator,Of course! I'm so invested in the lives of these characters!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Mabel,"(To Stan, who comes down the stairs wearing a suit:)Hey-hey, look at you! Someone's all dressed up."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Stan,"It's a big night. I think we all remember where we were, when we learned Duck-tective was shot."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Narration,An alarm goes off.
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Mabel,"(Gasps)Viewing positions, everyone!"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons","Grenda, Mabel and Stan","(Run to the living room, but stop and gasp when they see that Dipper and Ford have laid their game all over it)"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Grenda,Ah! Graph paper!(Stomping on it)Kill it! Kill it!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Mabel,"Dipper, could you maybe move this to another room?"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Ford,"No dice! We ran out of room in the basement and we're going for a world record! Now, dice!(rolls a 32)32, yes! 7,000 points damage!"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Dipper,(Laughing)You got me!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Stan,"Oh, why, why with this? You wanna break a record, Ford? You already got it for world's nerdiest old man."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Ford,"Hey, at least I'm not all keyed up to watch a kid's show."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Stan,I'll have you know that Duck-tective has a big mystery element! And a lot of humor that goes over kids' heads!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Grenda,"I don't get a lot of it, but I like animals in human situations."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Mabel,"Grunkle Stan, it starts in a few minutes!"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Stan,(Moves to take the paper off the TV)
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Ford,(Grabs his hand)Move that and pay the price!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Stan,"Oh, what, fifty magical dwarf dollars?"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Ford,Don't mock our fantastical monetary system!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Stan,"I'll mock all I want, it's my TV room!"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Ford,"It'smy house, you...(sighs)Listen, Stanley, did it ever occur to you to if you joined us you might actually have fun?"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Stan,What? Now you listen to me!(Takes Ford's bag)As long as I live I will never...

"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Probabilitor,"Mortals of dimension 46'\, kneel before me and(rolls dice)snivel! I am Probabilitor! The greatest wizard in all of mathology! Give or take an error of 0.4."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Stan,"Eh, is this normal?"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Dipper,Have you come to send us on the quest of a lifetime because we're the smartest players you've ever met?
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Probabilitor,Youarethe smartest players I've ever met! That's why I'm going to eat your brains to gain your intelligence. It's what I do.
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Ogre,It's his thing.
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Dipper,What?!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Probabilitor,Seize them!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Ford,"(Takes out a gun)Your math is no match for my gun, you idiot!"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Probabilitor,"Math ray!(Shoots a hole through the wall)I'm not here to play games!(Grabs Ford and Dipper and flies out, followed by the other characters)Now to the forest, for the ultimate game!"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Grenda,"So, the room's free now. Who wants to watch Duck-tective?(Squeaks Duck-tective toy)Nobody? More couch for Grenda!"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Narration,Commercial break.
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Mabel,Oh no! That crazy wizard is going to eat our brothers' brains! We have to stop 'em!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Stan,"Eh, maybe let 'em get a couple bites in Ford's brain first. Even things out smartness-wise."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Mabel,Grunkle Stan!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Stan,"Alright, alright. I guess if we have no other choice, we'll go on a...(Sighs)epic wizard quest."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Mabel and Grenda,YAAAAYY!!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Stan,Everyone grab a weapon.
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Narration,"Stan finds a bat in the couch cushion, Mabel takes a rake, and Grenda lifts up a chair."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Grenda,Heh. Nice!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Mabel,"We're coming for you, Dipper! And Great-uncle Ford! And possibly that hot elf, if he's got anything to do with this."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Narration,"They run off into the forest. Cut to Probability with Dipper and Ford, who are tied to a tree."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Probabilitor,"Heheheh.(Measures the Pines' heads)With each brain I eat, I shall increase my enchantelligence."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Ford,"If my hands were free, I'd break every part of your face."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Probabilitor,The time has come! Hot elf! Ready the brain-cooking pot!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Hot elf,"(Sighs)Yes, Probabilitor.(Shakes his hair and shoots a flaming arrow at the pot)"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Narration,"Cut to Grenda, Mabel, and Stan walking through the forest. Grenda is playing a lute."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Stan,(Slaps his back)We must be getting close. These fairy bites are getting more frequent.
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Fairy,(Crushed against Stan's suit)Hey! Look! Listen!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Ogre,"(Stomps in front of them)Halt! Yon interlopers are trespassing on the ancient forest of Probabilitor the wizard! If ye wish to pass, first, ye must complete seven unworldly quest, each, more difficult than the--"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Grenda,NO!(Hits him on the head with the chair and he collapses)
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Mabel,(Pokes his foot with the rake)Is he... dead?
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Stan,"He's magic, sweetie. I'm sure he's fine.(To Grenda:)There's no cops in the forest. We take this to our graves.(Exchanges winks with her)"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Narration,Cut back to Probabilitor.
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Probabilitor,Heheheheh.
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Dipper,What do we do? What do we do?
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Ford,"Stop thinking, Dipper! The more wrinkly your brain gets, the more he'll want to eat it!"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Probabilitor,"And now, a little math problem: when I subtract your brain from your skulls(Hits Ford and Dipper with his staff), add salt, and divide your family, what's the remainder?"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Mabel,(From behind the bushes)YOUR BUTT!!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Probabilitor,What? My butt isn't part of this particular equation.
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons","Grenda, Mabel and Stan",(Jump out of the bushes)
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Probabilitor,"Drat! How did you make it past my one guard? Very well. There's only one way your family can save you. YOU must defeat ME inDungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons: REAL LIFE EDITION!(Creates a gameboard)Hahaha-hahaha!"

"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Ford,Ah! My ears! They're so pointy!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Dipper,"There better be something protective under this tunic.(Turns around and opens tunic)Oh, no, there isn't!"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Stan,"Seriously, can't we just, like, arm wrestle or something?"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Probabilitor,"Come on, this game is a lot of fun. I had my mom pack me a lunch.(Takes some apple slices out of a paper bag)Ew, apple slices? I'll eatyoulast."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Stan,"Uh, just make with the rules, ugly.(Chews gum)"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Probabilitor,"The game is a battle royale. We help our characters by casting spells determined by rolls of the dice. If you win, I go back to my own dimension."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Mabel,(Claps)
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Probabilitor,"But if I win, I eat their brains."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Dipper,"Hey, I'm not sure this is such a good--"

"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Dipper,(Running away)Ah! Whoa!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Ford,Ah!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Stan,What do we do? What are our moves?!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Dipper,There are no moves; you make them up!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Stan,What? Really?
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Ford,"Yes! I tried to tell you: this game involves math, but also risk, and imagination!"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Stan,Risk?
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Mabel,"Imagination? Grunkle Stan, make something up! It's just like lying!"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Stan,"I cast, uh... shield of... shielding!(Rolls a 14 and a shield appears in front of Dipper and Ford)Ha! We're doing it!"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Probabilitor,Shield of Shielding Reversal Spell.(Rolls dice and the shield disappears)

"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Mabel,I cast: CENTAURTAUR! YAH!(Rolls the dice and a horse with another horse body for a head appears)
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Stan,"Mabel, I am so confused andsoproud right now."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Narration,Dipper and Ford get on the centaurtaur and it runs away from the ogre-nado.
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Mabel,"Go go go, Dipper go! You can do it!"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Stan,"(Simultaneously:)Come on, you guys! Go! Go!"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Narration,The centaurtaur runs into a smaller room and disappears. The ogre-nado tries to follow but falls apart.
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Mabel,Yeaahh!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Stan,Yes!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Probabilitor,(TheImpossibeastpicks up Dipper and Ford)Hahaha yes! I was saving the worst for last!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Dipper,Oh no!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Ford,"The Impossibeast! Hey, I thought they banned this character!"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Probabilitor,Think again! I'm playing the controversial 1991-1992 edition!(The Impossibeast slams Dipper and Ford against the wall)
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Mabel,(Shaking die)I'll think of some weapons!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Ford,You don't understand. This is the most powerful monster in the game! He can only be defeated by rolling a perfect 38! But the odds of that are--
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Stan,"(Takes the die from Mabel and shakes it)Hey, long odds are what you want when you're a world class gambler! Alright, Stan, you can do this... Papa needs a new pair of... TWINS!(throws the die and it lands on 38)"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Probabilitor,NOOO!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Stan,"Sorry, nerd-wizard. All your smarts are no match for dumb luck."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Mabel,I cast DEATH MUFFINS!(Muffins with dynamite sticking out of them appear in Dipper and Ford's hands)
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Dipper and Ford,(Throws the death muffins into the Impossibeast's mouth)
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Impossibeast,Huh?(Explodes in muffins)
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Stan,Yes!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Mabel,Yeeaah!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Narration,"Dipper and Ford, holding muffins, appear next to them in their normal clothes."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Mabel,(Hugs Dipper)Hahaha!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Hot elf,"(With Grenda hugging him, closes the rule book)The game is, like, over. Excelci-whatever."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Probabilitor,(Disappearing with the game)No! I'm returning to my own realm! I'm turning into pure math! What are the ooooodddsss??(Disappears)
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Dipper,"Grunkle Stan, that was amazing! How did you know that you would win?"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Stan,"Hey, a gambler never reveals his secrets.(Picks up the die, which has gum stuck to the bottom and starts chewing some new gum)"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Mabel,Man! Thatwasfun for ages 8 to 80! Or a million or however old you guys are!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Stan,"(To Dipper:)Y'know, I'm sorry for making fun of your game, kiddo. Sure, it might be too nerdy for me, bust it's just the right amount of nerdy for you and my brother. If you two wanna hang out sometimes, I won't get in your way."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Dipper,"Actually, after all that, I could use a little mindless fun."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Grenda,Guys! We can watch the second showing of Duck-tective! It's not too late!(Squeaks Duck-tective toy)
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Narration,"Cut to Dipper, Mabel, Grenda, Stan and Soos in the living room at night watching Duck-tective."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Duck-tective,"(On TV, on a hospital bed)Wah, wah-wah. Wah, wah-wah.(Subtitled:)I'm going to that big pond in the sky."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Constable,I just don't understand who shot you. The only person clever enough to defeat Duck-tective is--(Gasps)Duck-tective!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Duck-tective's brother,"(Throws a bedpan at Constable's head, knocking him out)Wa wa-wa-wa-wa... WA-WA-WA!(Subtitled:)Time to finish the job... TWIN BROTHER!"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Duck-tective,(TERRIFIED QUACK)
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Mabel,He had a twin brother all along?(Pouring chips onto Stan's lap) That'sthe big twist we were waiting for!?
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Grenda,WHAT A RIP-OFF!(Crushes a cookie)
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Soos,"I predicted that, like, a year ago."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Narration,Cut to the basement.
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Ford,(Locks the infinity-sided die away; to Dipper:)This'll be here if you ever need it.
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Dipper,Really? Even though I got us into the whole game-playing mess?
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Ford,"Eh, we both got carried away. I guess we'd both gone for a while without a friend. Dipper, can I tell you something?"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Dipper,(Nods smiling)
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Ford,"You asked me earlier what I was working on. Well,(pulls curtain down to reveal the portal is destroyed)I dismantled the portal. An interdimensional gateway is too dangerous for the world it feeds into. That's why I was mad at Stan for using it. He saved me but, as I feared, the instability of the machine created this:(Holds up a transparent sphere with a blob in it)aninterdimensional rift. I've contained it for now, but it's incredibly dangerous. Dipper, I don't want you to tell anyone about this. Not Stan, not even your sister. You understand?"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Dipper,"Oh-uh, of course."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Ford,"In my time I've made many powerful enemies, but Itrustyou with this secret. Now get yourself to bed. I have much research to do."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Dipper,"Goodnight, Great-uncle Ford."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Ford,"Goodnight, Dipper.(Puts the rift away)"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Narration,"Credits: Soos, Blubs, Durland and Toby Determined are role-play fighting in the yard."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Durland,"Guys, do you ever think that maybe we're doin' this 'cause our lives aren't special enough? That we use fantasy as an escape to avoid the self-improvement we all need? That maybe we should just go out and grow as people?"
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Sheriff Blubs,"Fortresses can't speak, Durland."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Durland,I'm a fortress!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Griffin,(Grabs Toby and flies away)
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Blubs,Does anyone want to rescue him?
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Durland,"Eh, I'm good."
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Soos,(Simultaneously:)I'm kinda- I'm kinda tired. Long day. Long day of FCLORPing.
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Voice over,Don't step to the wizard 'cause the wizard don't play nice- yeah!
"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons",Narration,End.
The Stanchurian Candidate,Narration,Scene opens fromStan'sperspective in theMystery Shackas he is waking up. It switches to a top view of him in bed.
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan Pines,"Alright Stan, another day, another random body pain. Here we go.(Puts on slippers that are soaked in milk)Ugh!"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Narration,"Finds a note on his desk that reads:""Dear Stan, I needed something to carry milk in so I used your slippers. Love,Mabel.""Stan shudders and walks into the kitchen and tries to turn on a light but the light bulb bursts. He groans and goes to find a new light bulb but finds that the box is empty except for a note that reads:""Dear Stan, I took these to build a planetarium suit forSoos! Sorry!Dipper.""Stan grumbles and crumples the note."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Narration,"Cut to Stan waiting in line in agrocery storeat the checkout counter with light bulbs.Robbie,Lee,TambryandNateshow up behind him."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Lee,"Whoa, let's not take this line. There's an old person in it."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Robbie Valentino,"Psh, yeah. He's probably gonna pay with like, pennies and war bonds."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,"Hey! For your information, I was gonna shoplift most of this."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Cashier,(Having heard that)Security!
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,"(Security guards rush to Stan)Ha!Smoke bomb!(Stan throws a smoke bomb on the floor that reads ""Exp. 11/1996""; nothing happens)Aw, seriously?(The security guards tackle Stan)Ahh!"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Narration,Cut to Stan coming home bruised with the box of light bulbs.
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,"Ugh. Rough start to a day.(Walks towards the kitchen)But it's all gonna be worth it when I fix that light bul —(Stan walks in to seeFordscrewing in a light bulb with Dipper, Mabel, and Soos)"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Ford Pines,And... we're... done!
The Stanchurian Candidate,"Dipper, Mabel and Soos",(Cheer)
The Stanchurian Candidate,Mabel,Does anyone see this? This is what a hero looks like right here.
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,I thought we were out of light bulbs.
The Stanchurian Candidate,Ford,"Oh we were, so I invented my own! It will last a thousand years and the light it emits makes your skin softer."
The Stanchurian Candidate,"Dipper, Mabel and Soos",(Rubbing their skin)Oooh!
The Stanchurian Candidate,Soos,Never have I known such softness!
The Stanchurian Candidate,Ford,"Anyway, where were you?"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,"(Drops new light bulbs in the trash; goes to the TV and picks up the remote)Well, TV at least you appreciate me. Give me the good news.(Turns on the TV)"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Shandra Jimenez,"(On the TV:)This just in, themayoris dead."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,What?!
The Stanchurian Candidate,Dipper,"(Walks in with Mabel)Whoa, what's going on?"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Shandra,"(On TV:)Raised by bears in the wilderness, Mayor Eustace Huckabone Befufftlefumpter was best known for raising thewater tower, possibly startingWorld War I, and putting town menaceGideon Gleefulbehind bars, in actual adultprison. A memorial statue is already being carved in the deceased mayor's honor.(Cries while her co-host comforts her)I'm sorry. It's just been so long since we've had real news. I'm just so happy!(Keeps crying)"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Shandra's co-host,(On TV:)There will be a town hall meeting this afternoon to discuss replacing him.
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,New mayor huh? Wonder who it could be...(Sees his reflection in the TV)
The Stanchurian Candidate,Narration,Cut to thetheme song.
The Stanchurian Candidate,Narration,Cut to all the citizens ofGravity Fallsin theTown Hall.
The Stanchurian Candidate,Sheriff Blubs,"Alright. Order! Order everyone! Calm down now! We're here to choose a mayor for the first time in almost a century. According to the town charter,(unrolls an old scroll as a bat flies out of it)a worthy candidate is defined as anyone who can cast a shadow, count to ten, and throw their hat into the provided ring.(Deputy Durlandbrings out a hoop and places it on the floor;Bud Gleefulimmediately throws his hat in it)"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Bud,Well now I do believe I fulfill all the requirements.
The Stanchurian Candidate,Dipper,"Wait, Bud Gleeful?"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Mabel,He looks good! Considering we threw his son in jail.
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,(Sitting back)That was a good day.
The Stanchurian Candidate,Bud,"Now folks, I know our family's had its fair shares of whoopsie daisies in the past, but I'd like to make up for it by formally announcing my candidacy for the mayor of Gravity Falls! Any questions?"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Toby Determined,"Yes, are you still in contact with Lil' Gideon?"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Bud,"That's a great question, I'm giving you 50% off a used car."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Toby,Fifty percent?! FIFTY PERCENT?!!!(Rips his notepad in half)
The Stanchurian Candidate,Bud,"In fact, everyone look under your seats.(Pointing at people in the crowd)Youget half off a used car!Youget half off a used car!"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Mabel,"(Pulls out a car discount coupon from under her chair)Wow, a colorful piece of paper? He's got my vote!"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Dipper,"Guys, I've got a really bad feeling about Bud Gleeful as mayor."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Soos,"I dunno, dude, it's not like we have a lot of good mayor options. Everyone in this town is a tad strange. Except, ironically,Tad Strange."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Tad Strange,"Hi guys, Tad's the name, and being normal's my game."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Mabel,"Loving you, Tad!"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Tad,(Holds up a slice of bread)And I love bread!
The Stanchurian Candidate,Dipper,"It's a shame Ford isn't here, he'd run. And win! And be a great mayor!"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Bud,"So since everyone's happy I'll just take the oath of office now, sound good, gavel up?(Stan throws his fez in the hoop, and everyone gasps)"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,Hold it right there Bud! I'm taking you on!(Everyone gasps)
The Stanchurian Candidate,Bud,Stanford? Noo-ffence but you're just some two-bit carnival barker. And your head is more ears than face!
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,Oh yeah? Well your face is more fat... than... not fat!(Everyone gasps)
The Stanchurian Candidate,Tad,Oh snap!
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,Whaddya say folks? Are we just gonna let Bud win? How about a real election!
The Stanchurian Candidate,Tyler Cutebiker,"Get in there, cap!(Everyone throws their hats in)"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Bud,"Well, looks like we've got some competition here folks. Which I'm fine with, totally fine with!(Pulls Stan towards him and talks quietly)I was gonna let bygones be bygones Stan, but you just made a powerful enemy. I'll win either way, and when I do, you might not like the Gravity Falls you wake up in!(Punches out the Mystery Shack on a map of Gravity Falls hanging on the wall)"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Dipper and Mabel,(Gasp)
The Stanchurian Candidate,Townspeople,Election! Election! Election!
The Stanchurian Candidate,Blubs,Let the madness begin!(Fires cannon)
The Stanchurian Candidate,Mabel,"Grunkle Stan, what are you doing?"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,Running for mayor! Did I... did I not make that clear?
The Stanchurian Candidate,Mabel,"Grunkle Stan, it's not that we think you can't do it, it's just —"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Dipper,"No no, it's okay, Mabel.(Turns to Stan)We don't think you can do it."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,"Look, kids. The mayor kicking the bucket got me thinking. I'm an old man, and I'm not getting any younger. My dumb brother's research is probably gonna make him famous. And what do I have to show for my life? Do I really want ""crooked grifter"" on my tombstone? How about, ""crooked mayor""!"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Dipper,"Psst, Mabel, let's talk.(Turns to Mabel)I know Stan isn't the best candidate. Heck, he's committing voter fraud right now.(Camera turns to show Stan, stuffing in votes into his own ballot box)But Bud's definitely up to something, and we're the only ones who can stop him."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Mabel,"You're right, Dipper. Besides, Stan has a kind-of charisma. How hard could getting him elected be?(Dipper takes off his pine tree cap and they both reach for matching hats and put on ""Vote Stan"" campaign stickers)"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Narration,"Cut to the Mystery Shack, which now has a sign over ""Mystery,"" reading ""Mayory Shack."" There are several U.S. flags and ""Vote Stan"" signs all over.Waddlesis withWendy, who has written on Waddles' body ""SWINES 4 PINES"" on one side and ""BUD'S A DUD"" on the other."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Wendy,"Spread the word, pig!(Waddles runs off)"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Dipper,"Alright everybody, eyes up here!(Opens a rolled paper with a lot of dust coming out)Okay, Gravity Falls Elections are based on two events. The Wednesday Stump Speech, held on an actual... stump, and the Friday Debate wherein townsfolk throw birdseed at the candidate they like most. At the end, they release a freedom eagle who will fly to the candidate covered in more seed and bestow a birdly kiss upon him anointing him mayor.(Shows everybody the parchment, frowning; while rolling paper:)I couldn't make this up if I wanted to."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Narration,"Phone rings in the ""Phone Bank."""
The Stanchurian Candidate,Mabel,"Okay Grunkle Stan, are you ready for your first radio interview?"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,"I got my mouth, don't I?"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Mabel,(On the phone:)Okay you're on with the candidate.
The Stanchurian Candidate,Voiceover,"You're listening to Falls Radio: 24 hour news and bear rampage alerts, and now here's theT-man."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Toby,Hello!Candidate Stan first question: How do you feel about the Americanflag?
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,"Meh, I can take it or leave it, too many stripes. Next question."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Narration,Cut to people atSkull Fracturelistening to the radio broadcast and grunting with doubt.
The Stanchurian Candidate,Toby,What would you do to help educate our kids?
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,"Ha, simple. Put them on an island and make them fight for dominance.(Cut to a family listening to the radio; woman covers her daughter's ears)Also teach kids swears. That'll bring them into the real world.(Cut to Mabel and Dipper, who look at each other worriedly)"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Toby,What would you do about the crime in Gravity Falls?
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,"Wait, do you mean crime in general, or just the specific crimes committed by m —"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Dipper,"(The phone line is cut off when Dipper cuts it with scissors)Okay, interview's over.Candy, what's the damage?"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Candy,Your approval ratings started at zero. Now it's a number lower than zero.(Flips laptop around and shows Stan's negative approval ratings)
The Stanchurian Candidate,Wendy,"You're meme-ing fast, and none of them are good.(Shows her phone, which has a meme of Stan on it that says: One does not simply ""teach kids swears"")"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Mabel,"Look Grunkle Stan, people are like smell markers, and you're black licorice! It's not that you're un-sniffable, you just need to learn when tokeep the cap on."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Dipper,"From now on, maybe you should just read ourpreparedremarks.(Holds up a folded piece of paper with ""YOUR SPEECH"" written on it with drawings by Mabel)"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,"Heh heh. Sorry kids. I always say words that come out of my brain. If my head says, that lady's got an ugly baby, my mouth says, ""whoa, lady, you got one ugly baby."""
The Stanchurian Candidate,Narration,"(Dipper and Mabel look at each other worriedly; cut tobasement, where Dipper is pacing around)"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Dipper,And he's insisting on speaking his mind!
The Stanchurian Candidate,Ford,So thisisan emergency.
The Stanchurian Candidate,Dipper,"The Stump Speech is in a couple of days, and if he continues like this, we'll lose to Bud for sure!"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Ford,"Hmm. It's a shame there isn't some device that would allow you to control someone else. Oh. Wait. Of course, yes. There is.(Shows Dipper a stripedtie)A long time ago I designed a prototype for Ronald Reagan's masters. Just get Stan to wear this, and you can make him a literal talking head."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Dipper,(Peers inside the tie)Whoa! This is amazing! And ethically ambiguous!
The Stanchurian Candidate,Ford,"(Takes out another tie that is darker)As long as you wear the matching one, he'll say and do whatever you want him to."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Dipper,(Holds up both ties) Thank you Great-uncle Ford!(Runs off)
The Stanchurian Candidate,Ford,"Yes, yes. Use it responsibly and all."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Narration,"Cuts to the Mystery Shack, where Dipper and Mabel are testing out the ties."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Soos,"(Puts on the tie)Whoa, thanks for the slamming tie, dudes! These stripes are so slimming!"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Mabel,(Turns to Dipper)You really think this mind-controlling tie is gonna work?
The Stanchurian Candidate,Dipper,(Takes out other tie)Flip the switch and test it out!(Mabel puts it on and flips the switch)
The Stanchurian Candidate,Mabel and Soos,(Singing and dancing)Oh-oh-oh! I'm a dancing dude! I got some fancy moves and a bad attitude!(Mabel switches it off and Soos starts sweating and panting)
The Stanchurian Candidate,Mabel,Ha! That's amazing!
The Stanchurian Candidate,Soos,Guys! Something weird just happened. I'm really freaked out!(Mabel flips the switch on again)
The Stanchurian Candidate,Mabel and Soos,"I am Soos-Tron! Watch me eat this pine cone!(Mabel mimics eating a pine cone while Soos actually eats one, and Mabel then flips the switch off; Soos collapses onto his hands and knees, panting again)"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Mabel,Mind control is awesome!
The Stanchurian Candidate,Soos,(Still panting)Oh my gosh! My life just flashed before my eyes! Aghh!
The Stanchurian Candidate,Narration,"Cut to Tyler giving a stump speech. A sign hangs across two trees saying: ""General Mayoral Stumpston Speeches"")"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Tyler,"Education, get it. Prosperity, get it. A Gravity Falls we can be proud of, get iiiiit!(Audience claps)"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,(Looks at tie)Ugh. Do I really have to wear this thing? It looks like a flag threw up on me.
The Stanchurian Candidate,Mabel,"Grunkle Stan, just trust your lucky tie."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Blubs,"And now, Stanford Pines!"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Mabel,"(Pushes Stan towards the stage)You're on, Grunkle Stan!(Slips on the mind control tie; turns to Dipper)Okay, we'll only jump in if he starts doing badly."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,(Enters through the curtains)Hiya there! Stan Pines here. Let's get real. Do you think the women of Gravity Falls wear too much makeup?
The Stanchurian Candidate,Dipper,Jump in! Jump in!
The Stanchurian Candidate,Mabel,(Turns on the switch)
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,"Uh, what I meant to say was: you ladies all look great. And have you done something with your hair? Girl, you areworking it!(Snaps his fingers)"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Woman,(Nodding with approval)Yes!
The Stanchurian Candidate,Girl with Bow,That isexactlywhat I needed to hear right now.
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,"Whew!(Wipes forehead)I'm Stan Pines. You may know me as the guy who accidentally let all those bees loose in that elementary school a few years back.(Dipper quickly pulls the tie off of Mabel and puts it on, gaining control of Stan)But I believe in things. America. Freedom. Ameri-freedom!"
The Stanchurian Candidate,America guy,Good! He's saying all the right things!(Eyes fill with tears; grabs the people beside him)
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,"Like my opponent pointed out, I may not have a pretty face, but if you want a candidate that will listen to you, well, I'm proud to be all ears.(Crowd cheers; Mabel takes control of Stan)Now, watch me break itdown!(Break dances then falls to the ground; the control goes off and Stan walks off stage, scratching his head in confusion)"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Mabel,"Grunkle Stan, that was amazing!(Hugs Stan)"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Soos,"Yeah! How'd you do it, Mr. Pines?"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,"Eh, I don't know. I just opened my mouth and spoke from the heart, or... gut, or something. And what is that sound? Why are people jamming their hands together?"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Mabel,"It's applause! Grunkle Stan, they love you!"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,They... love... me?(Pushes the curtain away to see the crowd cheering)
The Stanchurian Candidate,Crowd,"(Chants)Stan! Stan! Stan! Stan!(America guy rips his shirt open, revealing a bald eagle tattoo)"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Toby,"There he is! Mr. Pines, can we get a picture?"
The Stanchurian Candidate,"Dipper, Mabel, Stan and Soos",(All pose)Yes we Stan!
The Stanchurian Candidate,Narration,Toby takes their picture as a montage shows the twins continue to mind control Stan. Newspapers shown that Stan eventually gets the town's support and takes the lead. Cut to Bud slamming thenewspaperdown in frustration.
The Stanchurian Candidate,Bud,"Doggone it! Gosh heck huckleberry honey suckle darn it! Erm, excuse my language I'm so sorry.(Pulls out a pamphlet and starts to wipe himself with it)Oh, this is bad! This is real bad! I need to speak with my campaign manager, please excuse me for a moment.(Goes to another room then faces a screen and takes his hat off)Look, I'm sorry about all this. This is a minor setback, but... we'll win. I'm sure of it.(A camera then moves towards him)"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Gideon Gleeful,"Minor setback?(Camera moves away to reveal Gideon on the screen)Minor setback?! You listen, daddy, and you listen good. Prison is a nightmare!(Gideon slams his fists down and Bud backs away from the screen)I eat the same slop everyday! They have no hair products in here! I can't sleep because my cellmate took my pillow for a wife! You think I've been having fun in here?!"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Ghost-Eyes,"(Comes up from the background with another prisoner)Hey, best friend!"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Prisoner,Don't be late for friendship bracelet class!
The Stanchurian Candidate,Gideon,"I have finger painting at the same time!(Slams fist on desk and the prisoners leave)Whew! The mayor dying is my one ticket out of here. Which is why you're gonna win this election, pardon me out of prison and we're not gonna let the Pines get in my way again!"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Bud,But-but you don't understand. He's doing great in the polls! It's almost like magic!
The Stanchurian Candidate,Gideon,"Hmm, magic, you say? Well, maybe it's time we fight fire with fire!(Pulls a page fromJournal 2out of his hair)I've been saving this for a long time!(Zooms in on the page that read ""Possession Incantation"")I've been waiting for the right moment."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Bud,"Boy, now, we've discussed this, no more spooky spells."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Gideon,"Well daddy, maybe you just need to have more...(whispers)of an open mind. Lleps live ykoops, lleps live ykoops, live ykoops..."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Narration,"As he chants, the lights start to swing his eyes begin to glow. The bulbs eventually flickered out and burst violently. He continues chanting the same words as Bud speaks."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Bud,"(backs away)Oh, boy. Stop that!(Falls back and grabs his head)Anything but that!(Bud's eyes begin to glow white and screams)"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Narration,"Cut to a banner that reads ""Election Day!"" Pans to people murmuring as Stan happily passes by wearing a different suit."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Blubs,"Lookin' good, mayor candidate!"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Durland,Hooey! It's the guy I'm gonna vote for!
The Stanchurian Candidate,Tad,"Lookin' A-OK there, Stanford! A-OK!"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,"Tad, that means so much coming from you!(Bursts out of the door into theGreasy Diner)Hey-o!"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Lazy Susanand others,Stan!
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,Now just the ladies!
The Stanchurian Candidate,Ladies in the diner,Stan!
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,Now just the ladies my age!
The Stanchurian Candidate,Old lady,Stan!
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,"Woof! Never mind.(Sits together with the twins, with annoyed looks on their faces)"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Lazy Susan,"(Serves Stan a stack of pancakes with ""Stan 4 Mayor"" on it)On the house, mister big shot!"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,(Picks up knife and fork)Now this I could get used to!
The Stanchurian Candidate,Mabel,"Grunkle Stan, what's with the outfit? You're missing your lucky tie."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Dipper,"Power tie, gotta wear it."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,"Come on, have you seen the polls? I could debate naked and I'd still win! Huh, come to think of it..."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Mabel,"(Laughs nervously)Seriously though, we need you to wear that suit and tie, Grunkle Stan."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Dipper,"Suit and tie, gotta wear it."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,Ugh! What do you kids have to constantly tell me what to do? Everyone in this town is finally showing me respect! Maybe you kids should too.
The Stanchurian Candidate,Dipper,"Grunkle Stan, we'd respect you if you took things more seriously!"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,"(Slams fist on table)I am taking this seriously! If you haven't noticed, everything that has come out of this golden mouth has put us on top! With or without your dumb advice!"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Dipper,Dumb advice?!
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,Yeah! Dumb advice.
The Stanchurian Candidate,Dipper,"(Slams fists on table then stands up)Dang it, Stan! Every one of those speeches we were controlling you!"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Mabel,Dipper!
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,What?
The Stanchurian Candidate,Dipper,"This tie is a mind control device invented by Ford! If it wasn't for this tie, you'd be losing!(Peels back the front layer of the tie to reveal the circuitry in it)"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,"(In disbelief, then shaking with anger)Well, you can tell that know-it-all Ford that he can keep his fancy light bulbs and magic ties! I'm gonna win this debate on my own, without any of you!(Stands up)"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Dipper,"Stan, wait! You can't— (Stan slams the door shut)Augh, this is bad. If we wanna beat Bud, we need another candidate, fast!"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Mabel,"What we need is a blank slate, someone totally suggestible! An empty piece of clay we can mold to our whims."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Soos,"(Comes out the restroom with a sweater stuck to his head)Hey, a little help dudes? I accidentally got my head stuck in my shirt sleeve. I guess this is my life now.(Dipper and Mabel smile at each other)"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Narration,Cut to Mayor Befufftlefumpter's memorial then pans to the stage where the final debate takes place.
The Stanchurian Candidate,American Dude,(Holds up a box of bird seeds)Seed here! Support your favorite candidate by throwing election seed!(A man puts the mayor picking eagle in the cage)
The Stanchurian Candidate,Shandra,"Welcome, all, to the final debate in what's sure to be, on a cosmic scale, a forgettable blip in human history.(Candidates walk up to the stage waving)And here come the three most popular candidates!"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Gideon,"(Possessing Bud)Oh, hello there, Stanford! Long time, no see! Tee-hee! Woohoohoo!(Nudges Stan with his hip)"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,"Oh, don't you tee-hee me. I'll debate you into the ground."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Gideon,"(Bud's eyes glow a subtle blue)Oh, but I have a widdle twick up my sweevie-weeves."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,You're making me very uncomfortable right now.
The Stanchurian Candidate,Shandra,But what's this?(Soos walks up the stage wearing the mind control tie)One new candidate has entered the ring!
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,"Wait a minute. What?!(pans to reveal the twins backstage, controlling Soos)Those backstabbing..."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Shandra,Let the debate begin!(rings the bell)
The Stanchurian Candidate,Manly Dan,"First question. What's your position on axes! Wait, I mean...(squints on the card)taxes!"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,Easy! Taxes are the worst. I propose we stimulate the economy by waging wars on neighboring cities. We. Have. The cannons.(The crowd boos)What? Uh...(looks desperately on his queue cards)
The Stanchurian Candidate,Soos,"I don't know much about taxes, but I can promise you a kitten in every pot!(points accusingly to the left)That doesn't make sense, Mabel.(points accusingly to the right)Youdon't make sense, Dipper!(tie sparks up)"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Gideon,"Fwends, fwends. Can't you see what's happening on this stage? These politicians are dancing around the issues. Well...Icansingaround the issues!(rips apart his clothes to reveal a blue tank top, red sparkly pants and a belt with a small screen on it, catches a guitar and starts to sing)Ohcrime is bad! Crime is oh-so bad! Vote for Bud and there ain't gonna be no crime! Crime's bad. Vote Bud.(lays down and winks; Tyler claps)"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Shandra,You may now throw your bird seed!(crowd throws bird seed into Bud's box)And now a quick intermission.
The Stanchurian Candidate,Dipper,We're getting eaten alive back there! Since when is Bud been... creepily adorable?
The Stanchurian Candidate,Mabel,I don't know! It doesn't make sense! He's almost acting just like... like...
The Stanchurian Candidate,Gideon,"Widdle ol' me.(Mabel and Dipper gasp as Bud walks towards them with Gideon appearing on the screen)Aha! Hello there, long time no see! Except in my revenge fantasies where I see you on an hourly basis."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Dipper,Gideon! I knew you were somehow behind this! You've been controlling Bud!
The Stanchurian Candidate,Gideon,And it seemsyou'vebeen controlling Stanford! I have to hand it to both of y'all. You've got much eviller since I last saw you. Daddy!(snaps his fingers and Bud walks toward them)
The Stanchurian Candidate,Mabel,Let go of us!
The Stanchurian Candidate,Narration,Bud carries the twins to the elevator to the top of the mayor's memorial. Bud then proceeds to tie the twins up with the inside filled with fireworks.
The Stanchurian Candidate,Gideon,"Behold, your grand view of the debate! Once I win this election, I'll finally rule this backwoods town!"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Mabel,"You'll never get away with this, you creepy little dork!"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Gideon,"Oh, I'd be happy to spare you Mabel. If you agree to be mine. I even made you this wedding dress in crafts class!(whispers)Don't ask what it's made of."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Mabel,"Eww, I'd rather die, you creep!"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Gideon,"Fine! Have it your way. Once I win, they'll hit the plunger for the fireworks display, finishing the mountain's construction, trapping y'all inside. I've been trapped behind concrete all summer, now see how you like it!(the twins gasp)Say hello to the next mayor of Gravity Falls, kids! Muwahahahahahaha!(the twins struggle to get out)"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Narration,Cuts back to the stage.
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,"And uh, that is why, um... the Statue of Liberty is our hottest landmark.(crowd boos and Stan's audience approval rating goes down)Alright, I lied. She's kind of mannish. What do you want from me?"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Narration,The crowd continues to shower Bud's box with the bird seeds as his audience approval ratings goes up with Gideon smiling smugly at Stan.
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,"Augh. (grabs a piece of paper and wipes his forehead with it) You're dying out there, Stan.(sees that the paper is actually Dipper and Mabel's speech for him and his approval goes to zero)Kids, you were right all along. I should have listened to you when I had the chance."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Mabel,Help! Help us!
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,What the-?(looks to the mountain)
The Stanchurian Candidate,Dipper,We're tied to a bunch of fireworks!
The Stanchurian Candidate,Narration,"The twins try to jump out, but end up cracking the rock under them, hanging from the nose screaming with the rope fraying fast. Tyler screams and points to the twins hanging. Everyone looks up and gasps."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,(yelling)KIDS!
The Stanchurian Candidate,Narration,"The rope begins to fray even more, almost completely snapped in two. The twins yell and stare in shock."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,"(gasps, then turns to audience)Listen, everybody! This debate is over! I gotta go save my family!"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Gideon,"(turning to audience)Those, uh, those are just some... demolition dummies. Nothing to see here!"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,"(points at Bud)Can it, Gleeful!"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Narration,"Stan rips the sleeves off of his jacket and yells. He runs backstage and begins climbing up one of the towers near the memorial. The crowd gets up from their seats and moves to watch Stan. As this is happening, Shandra narrates the situation."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Shandra,"In a shocking turn of events, Stan Pines has run to the aid of two children who appear to be in danger!(The excited crowd begins throwing their bird seed at Stan himself.)And the crowd islovingit!"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,"(Still climbing tower and is adjacent to the twins. Is shrugging off birdseed)No, stop it!(turns to crowd)Thank you, but stop it!(eagles begin flying around Stan)Aah! Get back, you terror birds!(Stan punches them out and keeps climbing)"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Narration,"Stan gets to the top of the tower and leaps from it to the memorial's nose as the crowd points at him. As he regains his balance, the rope snaps in two. Before it falls, Stan catches it and begins pulling the twins up."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Dipper and Mabel,Grunkle Stan!
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,"(pulling the rope)Kids! Look, I'm sorry I was being stubborn. I guess being the town's hero wasn't enough. I wanted to be yours too."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Mabel,"We're sorry, Grunkle Stan. We should've supported you, win or lose."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Dipper,(rolls eyes) Probablylose.
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,"I can still drop you, you know."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Narration,"Stan finishes pulling the kids up. They and Stan are safe inside the memorial. Stan hugs the kids while they laugh. Cut to outside the memorial, where the crowd cheers as Stan stands on top of the memorial's nose with the twins on either side of him. Stan's box is overflowing with birdseed, and his approval rating is through the roof. Bud stares in shock."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Gideon,"(Sits down and bangs fists on floor)No, no, no, no, no, no, no, not again!(Steps down and grabs a primed remote detonator on the ground, glancing at the memorial)Time to take care of you, once and for all!"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Narration,"Zoom in on the memorial, where Dipper, Mabel, and Stan are staring at Bud in shock."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Dipper,Oh no! We have to get out of here!
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,"(solemn)Kids. If I die, make sure I get a bigger tombstone than Ford."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Narration,"The kids nod. Stan grabs them and jumps off of the memorial as Bud pushes the handle, blowing up the memorial. The kids and Stan scream, landing in the huge pile of Stan's bird seed unharmed. Cut to the crowd screaming and running away as chunks of the memorial rain down. One hits Bud and knocks him on the ground. Cut to static and zoom out to Gideon's cell, as his TV is knocked offline."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Gideon,"No!(rips the Journal page in half) No! (grabs his TV, throws it offscreen, and yells while tearing his hair)"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Narration,"Cut to the debate stage. The timer has finished counting down, and the mayor picking eagle is set free. It caws, flies overhead, and settles down near Stan, kissing his head. Cut to the memorial, with half of it molten and destroyed. The view pans down to the stage, where Stan is helping the twins out of the bird seed pile. He brushes himself off."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Crowd,(Cheering)Mayor Pines! Mayor Pines! Mayor Pines! Mayor Pines!
The Stanchurian Candidate,Narration,Fireworks begin to go off in the background.
The Stanchurian Candidate,Dipper,"Well, guess we know who won."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Narration,Cut to TV screen showing Stan's face.
The Stanchurian Candidate,Shandra,"(on TV:)This just in! Stanford Pines loses!(A red banner appears over Stan's face with the word ""DISQUALIFIED"" on it)"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Narration,"Cut to Dipper, Mabel, and Stan in the Mystery Shack watching the TV."
The Stanchurian Candidate,"Dipper, Mabel, and Stan",WHAT?!
The Stanchurian Candidate,Shandra,"(Now visible on the TV:)Despite winning an overwhelming 95% of the vote, election officials had to disqualify him due to discovery of an extensive criminal record."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,Oh boy.
The Stanchurian Candidate,Mabel,"Stan, what did you do?"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,Whatdidn'tI do?
The Stanchurian Candidate,Shandra,"(looks at papers)Crimes include shoplifting, teaching bears to drive, a new crime he invented called ""burglebezzlement"", first-degree llamacide...(Her expression becomes increasingly confused the more she reads)"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,(shakes fist)That llama knew too much.
The Stanchurian Candidate,Shandra,"(on TV:)Due to this shocking development, it would appear the mayorship passes to the only candidate who actually filled out their paperwork: local enthusiasm enthusiast Tyler Cutebiker."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Narration,The view on the TV cuts to Tyler on a podium. Durland and Blubs give him a mayoral sash and a bouquet of flowers. He blushes as the crowd cheers.
The Stanchurian Candidate,Tyler,(whispers) Got it.
The Stanchurian Candidate,Shandra,(handed a gigantic stack of paper)We will dedicate the rest of this broadcast to listing Stan's crimes.(picks up the first sheet)First-degree thermometer theft. Pug trafficking.
The Stanchurian Candidate,Narration,"As Shandra says this, some crimes are listed on the TV screen. The crimes read ""FIRST-DEGREE THERMOMETER THEFT. PUG TRAFFICKING. SNACKS EVASION. PICKPOCKETING. WOODPECKER BAITING. IMPERSONATING A DENTIST. GENERAL INDECENCY. GOLF CART THEFT. BINGO FRAUD. TELLING JOKES THAT JUST GO ON AND ON, I MEAN, I HAVE THINGS TO DO TODAY, REALLY."" Stan shuts off the TV."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,"Whew! At least they didn't list any of the bad ones. On an unrelated topic, I have a lot of cheap pugs and I need to move them fast."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Dipper,"Aw, I'm sorry, Stan. I actually think you as mayor would've been fun."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,"Eh, maybe it's for the best. I got close to the dream, though, kids."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Mabel,"Hey, I knit you something.(kneels down and gives Stan a sash that reads ""OUR HERO"")It's not official, but I think it fits.(gives the sash to Stan, who then sniffles)"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Dipper,"Grunkle Stan, are you crying?"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Stan,"(wipes eyes)I got campaign confetti in my eyes!(stands up and puts on the sash)Come on, kids. Wanna go vandalize Mayor Tyler's mansion?"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Mabel,Yay!
The Stanchurian Candidate,Dipper,"He-hey, vandalism!"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Narration,"Stan walks offscreen, as the twins run to him."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Narration,"Credits: Gideon is in prison, knitting with Ghost-Eyes."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Ghost-Eyes,"I'm sorry the election thing didn't work out for you, bro. But if it makes you feel any better, we're gonna throw a riot tonight!(sing-song)Does someone wanna throw a riot?"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Gideon,"Thanks, Ghost-Eyes. I'm just not in the mood."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Narration,"Cut to night. Gideon is in bed, wide awake. He sits up in his bed."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Gideon,"This poster is the only thing keeping me going.(looking at a poster that says ""HOLD ON TO THAT BRANCH OR DIE, CAT!"")"
The Stanchurian Candidate,Narration,"Gideon gets up and rips the poster off of his wall. Underneath it is a chalk drawing of theZodiac. The symbols aren't in their normal positions, and some of them are shaped differently.Billis drawn in the middle, without his eye. Gideon then draws the eye using chalk."
The Stanchurian Candidate,Gideon,I'm finally ready to make a deal.(A yellow glow envelops Gideon)
The Stanchurian Candidate,Narration,End
The Last Mabelcorn,Narration,"Episode opens with theMystery Shackat night. Cut toDipper Pinessleeping, thenMabel Pines, who is sleeping with her stuffed unicorn on top of her. She squeezes it."

The Last Mabelcorn,Narration,"Cut toFord Pinessleeping on the couch. Cut toFord's dream, where he appears in a field of wheat with a ruined swingset,interdimensional portal, and theStanowararound him. Ford looks around as the wheat is flattened around him into the image ofBill Cipher, glowing blue. Ford hears Bill's maniacal laughter."
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford Pines,"I know that laugh... Show yourself!(Turns around as Bill himself materializes from the ground, floating in the air)"
The Last Mabelcorn,Bill Cipher,"Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well!(Cuts to multiple copies of Bill materializing as he talks, forming a ring around Ford)Aren't you a sight for soreeye!(All of the Bills mirror each other's movements)Stanford Filbrick Pines, my old pal!"
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford,Bill Cipher. What do you want from me?
The Last Mabelcorn,Bill,"Oh, quit playing dumb, IQ!(Another Bill talks:)You knew I'd be back!(The Bill that's talking flicks Ford's nose)You think shutting down that portal could stop what I have planned?(All the Bills merge into one giant Bill that floats over Ford)I've been making deals, chatting with old friends, preparing forthe big day! You can't keep thatriftsafe forever.(Snaps his fingers and a copy of the interdimensional rift appears in his hand)You'll slip up, and when you do...!(Throws the rift onto the ground, where it creates a massive portal in the shape of an upside-down triangle, burning the wheat field around Ford)"
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford,Get out of here! You have no dominion in our world!
The Last Mabelcorn,Bill,"Maybe not right now, but things change, Stanford Pines!(Ford is reflected in Bill's eye as Bill ascends up into the portal)Things...(voice deepens:)change."
The Last Mabelcorn,Narration,"Bill laughs evilly as he flies away, leaving Ford within the ring of fire. Several images flash by at once, one of Ford's hand, one of Ford's eye and another of what looks like an extended version of theZodiac. Ford wakes up in his bed, panting. He adjusts his glasses."
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford,I have to warn them!(Looks at his hand)He's coming.
The Last Mabelcorn,Narration,Cut to thetheme song.
The Last Mabelcorn,Narration,"Cut to a shot of the exterior of the Mystery Shack in the daytime. Cut to Dipper opening a closet door and Mabel rubbing her hands excitedly. The two look at the closet, which contains some stray items and board games."
The Last Mabelcorn,Dipper Pines,"(Looks around the closet)Alright,Grunkle Stan'sgotta havesomedecent board games."
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel Pines,"Let's see, ""Battlechutes & Ladderships,"" ""Necronomiconopoly,"" ""Don't Wake Stalin""..."
The Last Mabelcorn,Dipper,"(Picks up a game)Hey, what's this? ""What Could Go Wrong?: The Board Game. The last players who opened this box never made it out alive."""
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel,"(After a short pause)Well, I guess I know what we're doing today."
The Last Mabelcorn,Dipper,(Talking over Mabel:)This should take up the next 21 minutes.
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford,(Off-screen:)Family meeting! Family meeting!
The Last Mabelcorn,Narration,"Dipper and Mabel react to Ford's demand. Cut to Stan Pines and another man, presumably named Santiago, standing in front of a truck outside the Mystery Shack. Stan is holding a wooden barrel of pugs."
The Last Mabelcorn,Stan Pines,"Alright, Santiago. You have twenty-four hours to get these pugs across the U.S. border."
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford,(Off-screen:)Family meeting! Family meeting!
The Last Mabelcorn,Stan,(Gives Santiago the pugs)No te preocupas! Vamos! Vamos!
The Last Mabelcorn,Narration,"Cut to Mabel and Dipper walking to Ford, who has several scrolls tucked under his arm and is reading a book. Ford turns around and notices the two, putting the scrolls on the table."
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford,"Ah, children. Come in, come in!"
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel,"(Takes a seat and looks at a bag on the table)Ooh, mysterious scrolls and potions! Are you going to tell us we're finally of age to go to wizard school?(Starts rummaging through the bag)Is there an owl in this bag?"
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford,"(Snatches the bag away)No! I can assure you if there's an owl in this bag, he's long dead.(Mabel frowns, disappointed)Now tell me, children, do either of you recognizethissymbol?(Holds up a scroll emblazoned with the image of Bill Cipher and several hieroglyphs)"
The Last Mabelcorn,Dipper and Mabel,(Gasp)
The Last Mabelcorn,Dipper,Bill.
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford,You... you know him?
The Last Mabelcorn,Dipper,Knowhim? He's been terrorizing us all summer! I have so many questions and theories...
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel,Dipper's been pretty paranoid since Billturned him into a living sock puppet.
The Last Mabelcorn,Dipper,The important thing is we defeated him twice.
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel,Once withkittensand once with tickles!
The Last Mabelcorn,Dipper,It was a lot more heroic than it sounds.
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford,The fact that you've dealt with Bill is gravely serious.
The Last Mabelcorn,Dipper,"So, how doyouknow Bill?"
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford,"I've encountered many dark beings in my time, Dipper. What matters is his powers are growing stronger, and if he pulls off his plans, no one in this family will be safe!"
The Last Mabelcorn,Dipper and Mabel,(Gasps)
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford,"Fortunately, there should be a way to shield us from his mental tricks. A way to Bill-proof the Shack.(Draws on a map of his lab)All I have to do is place moonstones here, here, and here, sprinkle some mercury, let's see... I always forget the last ingredient!(Takes outJournal 1and flips through it)Ugh,unicornhair."
The Last Mabelcorn,Dipper,"That's not, like, rare, is it?"
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford,"It's hopeless.(Looks at Journal 1; adjusts his glasses)Unicorns reside deep within an enchanted glade, and their hairs can only be obtained by a pure good-hearted person who goes on a magical quest to find them."
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel,"(Screams)Grunkle Ford, can Ipleasego on this quest? I am literally obsessed with unicorns! My first word was ""unicorn,"" I once made my own unicorn by taping a traffic cone to a horse's head.(Cut to a photo that reads ""BANNED FROM PETTING ZOO"" and has a picture of Mabel near a disgruntled horse with duct tape and a traffic cone on its head)Are you evenlooking at the sweater I'm wearing right now?!Not to mention that I'mprobablythe most pure of heart person in this room."
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford,"That's true, she has a point."
The Last Mabelcorn,Dipper,(Talking over Ford:)I can't argue there.
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel,So can I go on a mission to get that hair? Please please please? I'LL GIVE YOU MYBLOOD!
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford,Very well. But it won't be easy.(Gives Mabel Journal 1)Take this.(Hands Mabel a crossbow)And this.
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel,Oooh!
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford,"I haven't been in this dimension for a while. It's okay to give children weapons, right?"
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel,"Pssh, come on, dawg.(Fires the crossbow through the window, setting off theStanmobile's alarm)"
The Last Mabelcorn,Stan,(Off-screen:)AH! IT'S THE COPS! GUN IT!(Drives away accompanied by the sound of pugs yapping)
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel,"(To phone:)Candy, Grenda, Wendy, clear the afternoon!(Runs off)"
The Last Mabelcorn,Dipper,"So, what are the odds she gets that hair?"
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford,"Unlikely. I've dealt with unicorns before, and if I had to describe them in one word it would be... frustrating."
The Last Mabelcorn,Dipper,"So, what are we gonna do about Bill?"
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford,Follow me.
The Last Mabelcorn,Narration,"Dipper changes the sign on the Mystery Shack to ""Closed."" Dipper and Ford get into the elevator and get out onto the second floor."
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford,"Welcome to my private study, a place where I keep my most ancient and secret knowledge. Even your uncle Stan doesn't know about this place.(As Dipper stops to investigate a rectangular object covered by a sheet)Dipper, come along! If we can't Bill-proof the Shack, we're going to have to do the next best thing.(Holds up a helmet with wires on it)We're gonna have to Bill-proof our minds."
The Last Mabelcorn,Dipper,(Gasps)
The Last Mabelcorn,Narration,"Cut to Mabel, Candy, Grenda and Wendy in the woods."
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel,"It's nice to finally be out on a mission, just us gals!"
The Last Mabelcorn,Grenda Grendinator,"Forget the gal talk! I'm here to meet, touch and/or become a unicorn!"
The Last Mabelcorn,Candy Chiu,"I hear if you lick a unicorn's neck, it tastes like your favorite flavor in the world!"
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel,"Candy, I will makesureyou lick that unicorn's neck, because I care about my friends."
The Last Mabelcorn,Wendy Corduroy,"Honestly, I stopped believing in unicorns when I was like, five years old. I'm just coming along to keep you kids from walking into a bear trap."
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel,"Stop! This is the magic part of the forest.(Opens Journal 1)Let's see, thegnometavern is over there, thefairynail salon is over there, but it says to summon the unicorn, one must bellow this ancient chant droned only by the deepest-voiced druids of old."
The Last Mabelcorn,Grenda,(Takes the journal)On it!(Clears her throat)Oy-oyoy-oyoyoyoy...
The Last Mabelcorn,Wendy,I bet you ten bucks nothing happens.
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel,I'll take that bet.
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel and Wendy,(Gasps)
The Last Mabelcorn,Narration,"A fortress rises out of the ground. Mabel, Candy, Grenda and Wendy enter it."
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel,The paintings airbrushed on the sides of vans were true!
The Last Mabelcorn,Celestabellebethabelle,(Neighs)
The Last Mabelcorn,Grenda,Mother of mothers!
The Last Mabelcorn,Candy,Dream of dreams!
The Last Mabelcorn,Wendy,No way.
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel,"(Reaches her hand up towards Wendy and makes a grabbing motion)Eh, eh."
The Last Mabelcorn,Wendy,(Gives her a ten-dollar bill and sighs)
The Last Mabelcorn,Narration,Commercial break. Cuts to the four girls looking at the unicorn while a faun plays a pan flute nearby. The unicorn rears her head.
The Last Mabelcorn,Celestabellebethabelle,Hark! Visitors to my realm of enchantment!
The Last Mabelcorn,Narration,"Both Mabel and Candy gasp, and while Grenda is doing the same thing a butterfly flies straight into her mouth, causing her to gag."
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel,"Oh my gosh, oh my gosh! What's your name?"
The Last Mabelcorn,Celestabellebethabelle,"I am Celestabellebethabelle, last of my kind. Come in, come in. Just, take off your shoes. I have a whole thing about shoes."
The Last Mabelcorn,"Candy, Grenda and Mabel",(Take off their shoes)
The Last Mabelcorn,Celestabellebethabelle,"Ah, ah! I'm talking to all of you!"
The Last Mabelcorn,Wendy,(Grudgingly takes off her shoes)
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel,"Celestabellebethabelle, we have journeyed far and wide--"
The Last Mabelcorn,Grenda,About an hour!
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel,On a mission to protect our family with your magical hair!
The Last Mabelcorn,Candy,"(Standing next to Celestabellebethabelle)This is your chance, Candy. Lick the neck. Lick it...(Tries to lick it but fails as Celestabellebethabelle stands her neck straight up)"
The Last Mabelcorn,Celestabellebethabelle,"Very well. To receive a lock of my enchanted hair, step forth, girl of pure perfect heart."
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel,Presenting: bum buh da bum bum ba bum bum!(Kneels)Mabel!
The Last Mabelcorn,Celestabellebethabelle,"What? You? A unicorn can see deep inside your heart, child.(Points at Mabel with her horn and her chest glows with a heart)"
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel,Ugh!(Covers her chest)
The Last Mabelcorn,Celestabellebethabelle,And you have done wrong. WRONG I say!
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel,I guess Idomake fun of Dipper a lot. And Ididjust shatter a window with a crossbow.
The Last Mabelcorn,Celestabellebethabelle,"Your bad deeds make me cry.(Her eyes well up, and a tear lands on a flower, killing it)"
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel,NOOO!
The Last Mabelcorn,Celestabellebethabelle,"Come back when you're PURE OF HEART. NEEEIIGGGHH! Exit is that way. Shoes, shoes, take your shoes. This isn't some... some... shoe store."
The Last Mabelcorn,Narration,The humans leave and the gate closes.
The Last Mabelcorn,Grenda,"Hey, Mabel, don't let her get to you."
The Last Mabelcorn,Wendy,"Yeah, I wouldn't trust a horse that wears makeup."
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel,"No, girls, she's right. I used to be one of the sweetest people I knew, but recently I've been slacking in the whole goodness department. Well, today we're gonna fix it. From this moment forth I'm gonna do so many good deeds, I'll have the purest heart inGravity Falls!(Pumps fist in the air and accidentally punches a bird out of the air which opens Wendy's, Candy's, and Grenda's mouth as a form of minor shock for Mabel accidently punching that bird)That... that bird is fine."
The Last Mabelcorn,Narration,Cut to Ford's lab. Ford hooks Dipper up tohis mind machine.
The Last Mabelcorn,Dipper,"So what is Bill, exactly?"
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford,"No one knows for sure. Accounts differ of his true motivations and origins.(While Ford is talking, Dipper picks up ""The Cipher File"" and starts reading it)I know he's older than our galaxy and far more twisted. Without a physical form, he can only project himself into our thoughts through the mindscape. That's why he wantsthis. (Holds up the rift)I dismantled the portal, but with this tear, Bill still has a way into our reality. To get his hands on this rift, he would trick or possess anyone."
The Last Mabelcorn,Dipper,So how do we keep Bill out of our minds?
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford,"Well, there's a number of ways. I personally had a metal plate installed in my head."
The Last Mabelcorn,Dipper,Heheh. Good one.
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford,"(Knocks the side of his head, making a metallic sound)"
The Last Mabelcorn,Dipper,(Coughs and clears his throat)
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford,"But this machine is safer. It will scan your mind, bioelectrically encrypting your thoughts so Bill can't read them.(Turns it on)Now say hello to your thoughts."
The Last Mabelcorn,Dipper,"(On machine:)Oh, man, I can't believe I'm with the author. Is my fly down?(Singing:)DISCO GIRL! COMING THROUGH!(Talking:)Wendy. Wendy. Wendy. Wendy. Wendy.(Speaking to Ford:)You might wanna... ignore that last one. By the way, you never told me what your history with Bill was."
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford,"Dipper, do you trust me?"
The Last Mabelcorn,Dipper,"Well, yeah, but-"
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford,"Then you'll trust that that's not important. Now, focus. It's time to strengthen your mind."
The Last Mabelcorn,Narration,"Cut to Candy, Grenda, Mabel and Wendy on the sidewalk."
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel,"Alright, Mabel, it's time to strengthen your heart."
The Last Mabelcorn,Narration,"Montage: Mabel picks snails off the sidewalk and puts them on large grass. Mabel digs a hole and Grenda puts a tree in it.Toby Determinedtries to come outside but the tree has blocked his door. Mabel puts a giant smiley face sticker on Stan's face. He screams and breaks his lamp in the process. Mabel donates three pints of blood, then faints. Mabel stops traffic for some ducks to cross, paints glitter on the statue ofNathaniel Northwest, fillsLazy Susan'stip jar, and she, Candy, Grenda, and Wendy help a woman with her groceries."
The Last Mabelcorn,Singer,(Over montage) Share a smile!Dream a dream!Doing some good deeds!Share a smile!Plant a tree!Doing some good deeds!Halt! And smile!Love them tight!Doing good deeds!
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel,"(Looking at a checklist of good deeds; spoken over Candy, Grenda and Wendy's cheering)Boom! A thousand good deeds. When that unicorn scans my heart, she's gonna say I'm absolutely, one hundred percent, bonafide-"
The Last Mabelcorn,Narration,Cut to Celestabellebethabelle's fortress.
The Last Mabelcorn,Celestabellebethabelle,Not pure of heart.
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel,"Booyah! Wait, what?"
The Last Mabelcorn,Wendy,"How is that even possible? Mabel's a straight up saint, you judgmental hoofbag!"
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel,"Please, tell me what I'm doing wrong!"
The Last Mabelcorn,Celestabellebethabelle,"Doing good deeds to make yourself look better isn't good at all. Not to mention you're crushing, like, ten dandelions right now. Those are basically children's dreams."
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel,(Gets off the dandelions and gasps)
The Last Mabelcorn,Celestabellebethabelle,"I'm sorry, Mabel. It's not my fault you're a bad person."
The Last Mabelcorn,"Candy, Grenda and Wendy",(Gasp)
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel,(Runs off crying)
The Last Mabelcorn,Wendy,"Mabel, wait! Come back!"
The Last Mabelcorn,Celestabellebethabelle,"Now if you'll excuse me, I have a 3 o'clock posing in front of a rainbow.(Poses in front of a rainbow)NeigheighEIGHEIGHeigheigh."
The Last Mabelcorn,Narration,"Cut to Mabel lying down outside. Candy, Grenda and Wendy walk up to her."
The Last Mabelcorn,Wendy,"Come on, Mabel. Don't beat yourself up over this."
The Last Mabelcorn,Candy,Let's forget about getting that dumb unicorn hair.
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel,"It's not about the hair anymore, guys. It's about me. Being kind and sweet is what makes me who I am. If I'm not a good person, who am I? I'm not leaving this spot until I think of a deed that makes me as good as Celestabellebethabelle."
The Last Mabelcorn,Candy,"But, Mabel..."
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel,Just leave me be.
The Last Mabelcorn,Wendy,"Pst.(Ushers Candy and Grenda away)Guys, if you ask me, this whole thing is a serious load. Mabel's like the best person I've ever met. We tried getting that hair the good way. Now it's time we try... the Wendy way.(Wendy then punches and rubs her left fist against her right hand as a way of signaling a violent gesture)"
The Last Mabelcorn,Grenda,Are you suggesting violence? Sabotage?
The Last Mabelcorn,Candy,Mabel's not going to like that.
The Last Mabelcorn,Wendy,"Mabel doesn't need to know. Look, it's time we stop trying to be so ""perfect"" and be who we really are. We're crazed, angry, sweaty animals! We're not unicorns, we're WOMEN!AND WE TAKE WHAT WE WANT! (Punches a tree which brings a couple of leaves down to the ground)"
The Last Mabelcorn,Candy and Grenda,Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
The Last Mabelcorn,Grenda,(Smashes a rock on her head)Too much?
The Last Mabelcorn,Wendy,Here's what we're gonna do.
The Last Mabelcorn,Narration,Cut to Gnasty's.
The Last Mabelcorn,Gnome,"Get me a flaggon of your daintiest honeysuckle, please."
The Last Mabelcorn,Bartender,I'm gonna need to see some ID.
The Last Mabelcorn,Wendy,(Kicks the door open)
The Last Mabelcorn,Gnome,It's the cops! Hit the deck!(Another Gnome flings himself out the window)
The Last Mabelcorn,Wendy,I'm lookin' for someone who knows how to take down a unicorn! No tricks or games!
The Last Mabelcorn,Candy,(Smashes a bottle)We are human! We take what we want!
The Last Mabelcorn,Grenda,Yeah!
The Last Mabelcorn,Shady Gnome,"Fairy dust. A whole magic bag's enough to put a unicorn out cold. But if I do you a favor, you gotta do somethin' for me."
The Last Mabelcorn,Grenda,"Just, spill it, half-pint!(slams her fist against a tree stump)"
The Last Mabelcorn,Shady Gnome,"Butterfly trafficking is illegal in this part of the forest, but I like butterflies. They tickle my face and make me laugh. Bring me a bag of butterflies and we got a deal."
The Last Mabelcorn,Grenda and Wendy,(Nod)
The Last Mabelcorn,Narration,Cut to a net grabbing a butterfly. Cut back to Gnasty's. Grenda approaches the shady gnome and gives him the bag of butterflies.
The Last Mabelcorn,Shady Gnome,"Two bags of fairy dust, just like we agreed."
The Last Mabelcorn,Grenda,Where do you get this stuff?
The Last Mabelcorn,Shady Gnome,"Everyone likes sausage, but no one likes to know how it's made."
The Last Mabelcorn,Grenda,You disgust me.
The Last Mabelcorn,Shady Gnome,"You've got your poison, I've got mine; we made a deal."
The Last Mabelcorn,Grenda,"Yeah, well, the deal isoff!"
The Last Mabelcorn,Narration,Several policeman gnomes run out of the bushes.
The Last Mabelcorn,Police Gnome,Freeze! You're under arrest! Get down! Get down!
The Last Mabelcorn,Shady Gnome,These butterflies aren't mine! I swear! I've been framed!
The Last Mabelcorn,Police Gnome,Tell it to the adorable owl we've dressed as a judge.(To Grenda:)My cut.
The Last Mabelcorn,Grenda,(Gives him one of the bags)
The Last Mabelcorn,Narration,Cut to Mabel.
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel,"(Writing in her notepad)Good deeds. Good deeds. Aww that's not good enough! Come on, Mabel, you can do better than that!"
The Last Mabelcorn,"Candy, Grenda and Wendy",(Enter Celestabellebethabelle's house)
The Last Mabelcorn,Celestabellebethabelle,"(ReadingWhinny, Pray, Trot)Oh sure, sure, I wish I could travel, but it's just not feasible in this economy-(Gets hit with the fairy dust)What the hay?!(Faints)"
The Last Mabelcorn,Faun,(Nervously plays S.O.S in morse code on pipes)
The Last Mabelcorn,Grenda,(Puts a towel over its mouth)Sleep now! Sleeeeep.(Pulls the faun away as it loses consciousness)
The Last Mabelcorn,Wendy,(Takes scissors and some of Celestabellebethabelle's hair)
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel,(Enters the fortress)No wait! Stop!
The Last Mabelcorn,Wendy,Mabel! Shh! You'll wake her up!
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel,"(Takes scissors)But this is wrong, guys!"
The Last Mabelcorn,Wendy,But protecting the Shack is good.
The Last Mabelcorn,Celestabellebethabelle,(Gets up and sees Mabel with the scissors)What? Doth mine eyes deceive me? Thief! You shall never be pure of heeeaart!
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel,No! You don't understand! I just want to be good like you!
The Last Mabelcorn,Unicorn,"(Offscreen:)Whoa, whoa, whoa, you gotta be kidding me."
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel,Huh?
The Last Mabelcorn,Narration,The girls turn to the source of the voice. A pair of male unicorns step out from behind a tree that is near Celestabellebethabelle.
The Last Mabelcorn,Unicorn,"Yo, C-beth, are you seriously pulling this ""pure of heart"" scam again?"
The Last Mabelcorn,Unicorn's friend,"That is messed up, man."
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel,"Wait, scam?"
The Last Mabelcorn,Unicorn's friend,"Kid, unicorns can't see into your heart. All our dumb horns can do is glow, point towards the nearest rainbow and play rave music.(Plays music, then shuts it off)"
The Last Mabelcorn,Unicorn,"Yeah, the whole ""pure of heart"" racket is just a line we use to get humans to leave us alone."
The Last Mabelcorn,Celestabellebethabelle,Guuuyys. Shut uuupp.
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel,"(As she furiously looks at the notepad with ""Mabel's Sins"" written on it and crushes it)All this time. All this time I thought I was a bad person. But you're evenworsethan I am!(Throws notepad to the ground)"
The Last Mabelcorn,"Candy, Grenda and Wendy",(Gasp)
The Last Mabelcorn,Celestabellebethabelle,"Okay, fine. So you learned our secret. We're jerks, okay? We have more hair than we know what to do with, and we keep it to ourselves just to tick humans off.(Mockingly:)What are you gonna do about it, huh, huh? What are ya gonna DO?"
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel,(Punches Celestabellebethabelle)
The Last Mabelcorn,Celestabellebethabelle,Oh!
The Last Mabelcorn,"Candy, Grenda and Wendy",(Gasp)
The Last Mabelcorn,Wendy,WHOO! Go Mabel!
The Last Mabelcorn,Grenda,Join the dark side!
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel,(Growls and tears the unicorn image off of her sweater)
The Last Mabelcorn,"Candy, Grenda and Wendy",Fight! Fight! Fight!
The Last Mabelcorn,Celestabellebethabelle,"Oh. So it's a fight you want. Well, then it's a fight you're gonna get!"
The Last Mabelcorn,Narration,"The humans and the unicorns run at each other; just before they could plow into one another, cut to Ford's lab, where a screen says ""SCANNING THOUGHTS 15%."""
The Last Mabelcorn,Dipper,"Ugh, this is taking forever. How long have I been doing this for?(Sees that Ford is asleep)Why does he have to be so mysterious about Bill? I can handle the truth.(Thoughts on machine:)I wonder what Great-uncle Ford is thinking. Use the machine! It'll show you his thoughts.(Speaking:)I shouldn't...(On machine:)He won't know. He's going to tell you eventually. The more you know about Bill, the more you can help.(Speaking:)Man, I am really good at rationalizing.(On machine:)Yes, you are; yes, you are; yes, you are; yes, you are.(Puts the helmet on Ford's head; speaking:)Just a little peek. What are you hiding about Bill?"
The Last Mabelcorn,Narration,"Bill appears on the screen, cackling. Screen changes to Stanford moving around in his sleep. Smaller screens show the portal andMcGucketyelling at Ford."
The Last Mabelcorn,Old Man McGucket,Where are these ideas coming from? Who are you working with?!
The Last Mabelcorn,Narration,"Screens change to Ford writing ""I'M LOSING,"" ""MY MIND,"" and ""TRUST NO ONE"" in the journal."
The Last Mabelcorn,Stan,(Voice on machine:)My brother is a dangerous know-it-all...
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford,(On machine:)He would trick or possess anyone...(As a young man:)Then it's a deal. From now until the end of time.
The Last Mabelcorn,Bill,"(Holding out hand, which is on fire)Just let me into your mind, Stanford."
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford,"Please, call me...(Shaking hands)a friend."
The Last Mabelcorn,Bill,"(Possessing Ford, cackling)"
The Last Mabelcorn,Dipper,FORD AND BILL?!(Gasps)
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford,"(Stands up)You shouldn't have done that.(Takes off helmet and throws it, knocking down a curtain, revealing many items depicting Bill)"
The Last Mabelcorn,Dipper,"Why- why were you shaking hands with Bill?(Picks up the rift)You said Bill could possess anyone so he could get this.(The rift slips out of his hand, and he catches it)Ahh!"
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford,"Careful! Hand me the rift! Now, boy!"
The Last Mabelcorn,Dipper,(Backing away)Why were you really scanning my thoughts?(AimsMemory Gunat Ford)Are you Bill right now?!
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford,"Now just-just calm down, P-"
The Last Mabelcorn,Dipper,(scared)PINE TREE?!IS THAT WHAT YOU WERE GONNA CALL ME?!
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford,"I was gonna say ""please"", kid!"
The Last Mabelcorn,Dipper,(Stops at the end of the room)Great-uncle Ford told me to protect the rift! Get one step closer and I'll shoot! I'll erase you right out of Ford's head!
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford,"It's me, Dipper. It's your uncle!"
The Last Mabelcorn,Dipper,"(Charging gun)Trust no one, trust no one, trust..."
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford,Hand it to me!
The Last Mabelcorn,Narration,"The gun fires at Ford, but bounces off his glasses and around the room, finally destroying one of the screens."
The Last Mabelcorn,Dipper,(Tries to pick up the memory erasing gun)
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford,(Picks Dipper up before he can get the gun)
The Last Mabelcorn,Dipper,(Trying to hit him)Let go of me!
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford,"Now-now just calm down. Calm down!(adjusts his glasses, showing his eyes are normal)Look into my eyes! Look at my pupils. It's me, Dipper. It's me.(Sets him down)"
The Last Mabelcorn,Dipper,(Sighs)I tried to erase your mind. I'm so sorry.
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford,"It's okay, Dipper. Besides, my mind can't be erased, anyway, remember?(Knocks the side of his head)If that really was Bill, though, you would've done great. I should have been more like you when I was young. Dipper, I was a fool to try to hide all this. The reason I've been trying to prepare you for Bill's tricks is that Bill tricked me. It's the biggest regret of my life. Bill wasn't always my enemy, Dipper. I used to think he was my friend. Long, long ago.(Flashback to Ford as a young man in front of a printer)I had hit a road block in my investigation of Gravity Falls.(Punches the drawing of the question mark he had made on his chalkboard; cut to him in a cave)Until I found some mysterious writing in a cave. Ancient incantations about a being with answers. It warned me not to read them, but I was desperate. I read the inscription aloud. But nothing happened. Until later that afternoon, when I had the most peculiar dream.(Ford is sleeping under a tree. The knots on the trees become Bill eyes and the rest of the backround fades into abstraction. Journals and pages are floating about randomly. Ford gets up and walks around.)"
The Last Mabelcorn,Bill,"(Comes up behind him)Hiya, smart guy!(Circles around him)Woah, don't have a heart attack, you're not ninety-two yet!"
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford,(In flashback)Who are you?
The Last Mabelcorn,Bill,"Name's Bill! And your name's Stanford Pines, the man who changed the world, but I'm getting ahead of ourselves; let's relax! Care for a game of interdimensional chess?(Chessboard appears)Have a cup of tea.(Teapot pours tea into a teacup)"
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford,"(Voice-over from the present:)He told me he was a muse. That he chose one brilliant mind a century to inspire. What a fool I was. Blinded by his flattery and games. He became my research assistant. He was free to move in and out of my mind as he pleased.(Cut to Ford summoning Bill, who possesses him.)We were partners.(Cut to Ford and Bill in the mindscape, doing an equation with a picture of the portal next to it)When he told me that I could complete my research by building a gateway to other worlds, I trusted him. He said this was the way genius happened, with a little help from a friend.(Cut to Ford and McGucket in front of the portal)It seemed that I was on the verge of my greatest achievement!(The portal activates; cut to Ford with McGucket, who is catatonic)Until my partner got a glimpse of Bill's true plans.(Cut to Ford approaching Bill)Bill! You lied to me! Where does that portal really lead?"
The Last Mabelcorn,Bill,"(Looking at what looks like a scar in space withdark shapesin it)Hoho! Looks like Mr. Brainiac finally got smart! Let's just say that when that portal finishes charging up, your dimension is gonna learn how to party!(To the scar:)Right, guys?"
The Last Mabelcorn,Bill Cipher's gang,(Roaring and cackling)
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford,No! I'll stop you! I'll SHUT IT DOWN!
The Last Mabelcorn,Bill,"A deal's a deal, Sixer! You can't stop the bridge between our worlds from coming, butit would be fun to watch you try!Cute even!"
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford,"(Wakes up, shocked)I'd been betrayed. I shut the portal down,(Cut to Ford shutting the portal down)severing the link between Bill's world and ours. I had to hide my instructions so no one could ever finish Bill's work.(Cut to the present)Bill's been waiting for the gateway to reopen ever since. All he needs to do is get his hands on this rift. To Bill, it's just a game, but tous, it would mean theendof our world."
The Last Mabelcorn,Dipper,"Oh, man."
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford,"Oh, man, indeed."
The Last Mabelcorn,Narration,Cut to Dipper and Ford in the living room drinkingPitt Cola.
The Last Mabelcorn,Dipper,"Ugh, I'm so embarrassed about earlier. I'm such an idiot."
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford,"From now on, no more secrets between us. We're not the first two idiots to be tricked by Bill, boy. But if we work together, wecouldbe the last."
The Last Mabelcorn,Dipper,But what about Bill? I broke the machine! Now we have no way to protect the shack!
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel,"(Slams the unicorn hair on the table)Did someone say ""unicorn hair""?!"
The Last Mabelcorn,Narration,"Candy, Grenda, Mabel and Wendy are behind her. They are all beat up and covered in unicorn fluids and tears."
The Last Mabelcorn,Dipper,"Uh, no, actually?"
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel,Oh. That would have been perfect. Either way we got some unicorn hair!(Waves it in Dipper's face)
The Last Mabelcorn,Candy,"Also some unicorn tears, unicorn eyelashes...(Gestures to Grenda, who has unicorn eyelashes)"
The Last Mabelcorn,Grenda,They finally gave us this treasure just to get rid of us!(Dumps treasure on table)
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford,"It... can't be! This is a great day, girls! With this unicorn hair, we'll be able to completely shield the shack from Bill's mind-reading tricks!"
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel,Is it okay?
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford,"Better than okay; it's perfect! You've protected your family. You're a good person, Mabel."
The Last Mabelcorn,Mabel,"Thanks, Grunkle Ford, but today I learned that morality is relative."
The Last Mabelcorn,Stan,(Runs in and grabs some of the treasure)MONEY!!(Runs away)
The Last Mabelcorn,Narration,End credits: Dipper and Ford are in the yard. Dipper finishes stretching the unicorn hair around the shack. A force field forms around the shack.
The Last Mabelcorn,Ford,"Perfect! This will protect us from Bill! As long as we're inside, our minds are safe."
The Last Mabelcorn,Bill,"(Watching them from theNightmare Realm)I guess I can't possess anyoneinside the shack, so I'll just have to find my next pawn on the(Voice deepens:)OUTSIDE.(Eye flashes between several characters)"
Roadside Attraction,Narration,"Episode opens with theMystery Shack, to the back ofGrunkle Stan's RV. Grunkle Stan puts a bumper sticker on it that says ""CAUTION: SILVERFOX AT THE WHEEL"" as Soos helps pack it up."
Roadside Attraction,Stan Pines,(Hums)Nice. And don't forget bug spray! It's perfect for spraying in the face of hitchhikers.
Roadside Attraction,Dipper Pines,Whoa. An RV? Camping gear? Are you running from the law again?
Roadside Attraction,Soos Ramirez,(On top of RV)Dude! It's the ultimate Oregon road trip adventure!
Roadside Attraction,Stan,More likerevengetrip. Every year my tourist trap competitors prank the Mystery Shack. Last year those hooligans duct taped Soos to the ceiling.
Roadside Attraction,Soos,That was a fun 78 hours.
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"Well, no more!(Pulls out a map of Oregon's tourist traps and hands it to Dipper)This year we're visiting every tourist trap along the Redwood Highway, and I'm gonna prank back every single one."
Roadside Attraction,Grenda Grendinator,Bow wow! Time to let the road dogsbark!
Roadside Attraction,Candy Chiu,That is us. We are the road dogs.
Roadside Attraction,Mabel Pines,"Thanks for letting me bring Candy and Grenda along for our road trip, Grunkle Stan."
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"The more the merrier. Just sign these non-disclosure agreements. None of your parents are lawyers, right?(Stan, Candy, and Grenda walk into the RV)"
Roadside Attraction,Soos,"(Jumps down from the roof of the RV)What do ya say, dude? You comin'?"
Roadside Attraction,Mabel,"I already went to the trouble of packing all your stuff. Even the stuff you kept in that secret box under the bed.(drops the box, pictures ofWendycoming out of it)Whoa. What the...? Ugh,what's that?"
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,"(Starts cleaning the pictures up)Uh, nothing! Just...Wendy stuff...from old times."
Roadside Attraction,Mabel and Soos,Ughh.
Roadside Attraction,Mabel,"Bro, I thought you were finally past all this."
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,"Ahh, I know, I know! I know she's not interested and I know it's over, but how do you just turn off the way you feel about someone?"
Roadside Attraction,Mabel,"Two words, Dipper. Move. On."
Roadside Attraction,Soos,"Yeah, dude. And a road trip's the perfect place to meet new people."
Roadside Attraction,Narration,"Dipper looks at a picture of Wendy, then at the pamphlet. He looks up into the sky and smiles."
Roadside Attraction,Narration,(Cut totheme song)
Roadside Attraction,Narration,The RV bounds across the open road. Stan is driving as Soos pants with his tongue sticking out.
Roadside Attraction,Grenda,"Man, RVs are amazing. I can't believe we're sitting at a table in a moving vehicle!"
Roadside Attraction,Candy,Ooh! Informational travel pamphlets.(Pressing pamphlets to her cheeks)I want to read them all and gain their travel knowledge.
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"Kid, those useless pamphlets have never helped a single person. The only wrinkly old travel guide you'll need is me. Now look alive! We're coming up on an attraction run by the most black-hearted proprietor in all of Oregon."
Roadside Attraction,Narration,Cut to a sign outsideGranny Sweetkin's Yarnball. The RV pulls up next to it and stops.
Roadside Attraction,Stan,Don't let the face fool you. This woman lit my car on fire on two non-consecutive occasions.
Roadside Attraction,Narration,Cut to outside the RV. The kids have gotten out and are staring at the yarn ball.
Roadside Attraction,"Dipper, Mabel, Candy and Grenda",Whoa.
Roadside Attraction,Mabel,"I'm going in, girls. Waaah.(Mabel goes inside the yarn. Candy laughs and follows her.)"
Roadside Attraction,Grenda,Yarn!(goes inside the yarn)
Roadside Attraction,Narration,A tourist girl walks by Dipper.
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,"Okay. Like Soos said, meet new people.(Walks up to girl and clears throat)So, uh...come here often?"
Roadside Attraction,Unnamed tourist girl,No. I'm a tourist.
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,"(laughs nervously)You're funny. And cute. I mean, not cute. I mean, you're notnotcute. Phew, let me start over.(extending hand)My name is Dopper.(She dumps her ice cream in his hand and walks away as Dipper sighs)"
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"(Over the walkie talkie:)Dipper, hup to! This ball a' yarn ain't gonna prank itself."
Roadside Attraction,Narration,Dipper takes a piece of the yarn ball from Mabel and ties it to the back of the RV. He sighs.
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"Something on your mind, kiddo? You're thinking about miss cold shoulder over there, huh?"
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,"Ahh, I'm so embarrassed. Look, earlier this summer I ruined my chances with Wendy."
Roadside Attraction,Narration,"As they talk, Mabel and Grenda pop out of the top of the yarn ball and high-five."
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"Heh, yeah. Chances."
Roadside Attraction,Narration,Mabel and Grenda begin unraveling the yarn ball behind them.
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,"And I wanna move on, but I'm terrible at talking to girls. The moment I open my mouth around them I unravel like...like...well, I can't think of a perfect metaphor, but you get the gist. At this rate, I'm going to grow up to be a sad loner likeToby Determined."
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"Whoa. Never say that about yourself. Lucky for you I'm an expert on women. Listen to me, kid. When it comes to girls always be confident. And be funny, but not too funny. And be kinda annoying but in a lovable way."
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,"I don't know, Grunkle Stan. This sounds kinda jerky."
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"Hey, jerky is just a term non-jerks use to bad mouth innocent jerks. Confidence, comedy, some third word starting with a C. The three Cs of the Stan Pines dating technique! At the next tourist trap, try out my advice on the first girl you see."
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,"Cool. Grunkle Stan, thanks."
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"Hey, I'm full a good ideas. Speakin' of which, everyone! Now!"
Roadside Attraction,Narration,"Dipper, Stan, and Soos run into the RV. Mabel, Candy, and Grenda get out of the yarn ball and follow them. The RV speeds away, unraveling the yarn ball completely."
Roadside Attraction,Granny Sweetkin,"Why, you gall darn son of a no good.(Takes a nail out of the ground and throws it at the RV)I'll get you, Stan Pines!"
Roadside Attraction,Narration,Cut toUpside-Down Town. The RV pulls up and stops.
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"Ah, Upside-Down Town. The nausea capital of the state. Whatever you do, don't use the bathrooms."
Roadside Attraction,Narration,"The kids put on shoes with Velcro on the bottom, so they can walk on the carpeted ceiling."
Roadside Attraction,"Mabel, Candy and Grenda","Road dogs! Woof, woof, woof!"
Roadside Attraction,Narration,"The kids get aligned with the ceiling and walk into the house, laughing."
Roadside Attraction,Grenda,Nice!
Roadside Attraction,Mabel,This is so weird!
Roadside Attraction,Narration,Dipper walks in as he noticesEmma Sue.
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"(in Dipper's head:)Alright, kid. This is it. Be confident."
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,"(Clears throat)Hi, I'm Dipper. Crazy place, right?"
Roadside Attraction,Emma Sue,"Oh, hi. I'm Emma Sue. You know, if you pretend we're right side up, it looks like everyone's hair is standing on end."
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,"Huh. Yeah, weird, right? Pretend you're screaming."
Roadside Attraction,Emma Sue,"Okay. You gotta take a picture of me, though.(Screams as Dipper takes a picture with her phone)"
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,"Let's see about--whoa!(He lets go of the phone before catching it)Huh-hoh, just kidding.(laughs)"
Roadside Attraction,Emma Sue,(playfully:)You are the worst.(softly punches Dipper)
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,"You bet I am. I'm bad, Emma. Kind of a jerk."
Roadside Attraction,Emma Sue's Father,"Emma, come on! We have to get to Canada before your mother gives birth!"
Roadside Attraction,Emma Sue,It's a long story.
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,Maybe you could tell me sometime.
Roadside Attraction,Emma Sue,Here's my email address. Write me and I'll tell you all about it.(Writes her email on Dipper's hand and walks away)
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,"A girl gave me her email. And it wasn't out of pity! Haha! Yes!(Jumps in the air and falls to the floor, landing next to Mabel)I'm okay. I'm better than okay. Mabel, hi. There's my Grenda. Candy, looking great, looking great. Is that a new pair of glasses? Very shiny.(Candy blushes deeply)Hahaha. Wooo!"
Roadside Attraction,Grenda,"Maybe it's the blood pooling in my head, but Dipper seems different.(Groans as her forehead turns purple)"
Roadside Attraction,Candy,Yes. Good different.
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"(off screen)Now, Soos!"
Roadside Attraction,Narration,"Stan and Soos start jumping on the floor, rolling the house and turning it right-side up. The gang runs to the RV and drives away."
Roadside Attraction,Stan,Not so upside-down now!(laughs)
Roadside Attraction,Civilian,What a lovely normal home!
Roadside Attraction,Upside-Down Town Boss,Stan Pines!
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,(Looks at Emma's e-mail)I can't believe it worked. What do I do now? Do I e-mail her?
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"No, no, no. You practice. The more girls you talk to, the better you get at it."
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,"Grunkle Stan, these tips are priceless."
Roadside Attraction,Stan,And that's just the tip of the advice-berg.
Roadside Attraction,Narration,(A montage begins. Dipper flirts with girls at Log Land and theCorn Mazeas Stan sabotages the attractions. Soos walks into a random area of the Corn Maze as the rest of the gang runs back into the RV.)
Roadside Attraction,Stan,Everyone on board?
Roadside Attraction,Mabel,Probably.
Roadside Attraction,Narration,"The RV drives away, leaving Soos behind."
Roadside Attraction,Soos,Guys? Hello? Anyone? They'll come back for me.
Roadside Attraction,Narration,Cut to Septic Ridge RV Park at night. Dipper and Stan are relaxing in a hot tub.
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"So then I said to the bouncer, ""Where's your ID, ugly?""(points to a scar on his under right arm)That's where I gotthisscar."
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,"(laughs)Grunkle Stan, I gotta say this was one of the best days ever. Look!(Holds up arms with phone numbers on them)"
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"That's the Stan Pines method, kid. Works every time."
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,"I'm just a little worried, though. I mean is it bad to flirt with this many girls at once? I'm just tryin'a get over Wendy. I don't wanna hurt anyone's feelings."
Roadside Attraction,Stan,Please. That's the best part 'a flirting on a road trip. You're not gonna see any of these gals again. To moving on!(Stan and Dipper laugh)
Roadside Attraction,Narration,"Screen pans to Mabel, Grenda and Candy sitting at a bonfire next to the RV, eating marshmallows and laughing."
Roadside Attraction,Mabel,"Okay, it's time for..."
Roadside Attraction,Mabel and Grenda,...Truth or Dare or Don't!(point at Candy)
Roadside Attraction,Candy,I choose... don't!
Roadside Attraction,Grenda,Ugh! You always choose don't.
Roadside Attraction,Candy,"Fine. Uh, truth."
Roadside Attraction,Mabel,Do you...likesomeone?(Candy blushes)
Roadside Attraction,Grenda,Uh-oh. Someone's blushing.
Roadside Attraction,Candy,"Okay, maybe just a little. I don't know for sure. It just... started."
Roadside Attraction,Mabel and Grenda,Tell us! Tell us!
Roadside Attraction,Candy,"Okay. It begins with a ""D"" and ends with an ""ipper."""
Roadside Attraction,Mabel,(shocked)No.
Roadside Attraction,Candy,Yes.
Roadside Attraction,Mabel and Grenda,(Gasp)
Roadside Attraction,Mabel,"Ready, Grenda? Three. Two. One.(Mabel and Grenda gasp before screaming loudly. Dipper and Stan look around.)"
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"Man, coyotes sound a lot worse than I remember."
Roadside Attraction,Mabel,(Giggling with Grenda)Candy. Candy! All my life dreams are coming true right now. My brother. My best friend.
Roadside Attraction,Grenda,I can't breathe! I'm so excited I can'tbreathe! (Falls backwards)
Roadside Attraction,Candy,"I never really noticed him before, but he seems different lately. Less sweaty, and more charming. But how do I approach him?"
Roadside Attraction,Mabel,"Don't even worry about that, Can-Can. Mabel's got a plan.(Shoves marshmallows in her mouth)Mabel's got a plan."
Roadside Attraction,Narration,Cut to the road. The RV is back on the highway.
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"Alright, campers. We got another day 'a breakin' laws and breakin' hearts. Everything up until now has been a walk in the park compared to our next attraction."
Roadside Attraction,Mabel,Is it a walk in the world's biggest park?
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"Eh, sort of. There she is, kids.Mystery Mountain. Five times the size of the Mystery Shack, and what's worse: she has real attractions."
Roadside Attraction,Candy,"Oh! I have read about this place. It has sky tram. And a mummy museum. And sightings ofhalf human, half spider creatures."
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"Even their made up legends are better than ours. Today, the mountainfalls."
Roadside Attraction,Mabel,(nods at Grenda)Question. The back seat makes me car sick. Can I sit up front today?
Roadside Attraction,Grenda,Also question. I'm the size of two people. Can I have a whole seat to myself?
Roadside Attraction,Candy,(looks up from the pamphlet and blushes)
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"Eh, I don't know, sure."
Roadside Attraction,Mabel,(runs to shotgun seat)Whooo! Change up!(yells as she pushes Dipper out of the seat and into the back seat)
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,"But wait! That means it'll just be me and--(looks at Candy, who is sitting next to her)"
Roadside Attraction,Candy,(blushing)Candy Chiu! 6th grade!
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,(jumps back)Whoa! Hey.
Roadside Attraction,Narration,"Dipper and Candy awkwardly sit in silence. After a few seconds, Candy moves closer to Dipper."
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,You're sitting close.
Roadside Attraction,Grenda,(giggles with Mabel as she moves a curtain over the back seat)
Roadside Attraction,Candy,"So, Dipper. I was wondering, would you maybe want to walk around the Mystery Mountain with me today?"
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,"Ssssure, I mean, wasn't that already the plan?(scoots away from Candy)"
Roadside Attraction,Candy,"I mean, just us. You and me. Candy and Dipper."
Roadside Attraction,Narration,"Dipper looks shocked as Stan slams the brakes on the car, coming to a stop in front of the Mystery Mountain entrance. Cut to Stan outside the RV."
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"Alright, road dogs! I got five bucks for whoever can tip the big blue ox! Go, go, go!(Ushers Mabel and Grenda out)"
Roadside Attraction,Candy,(to Dipper:)I will see you in there!(giggles and walks away)
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"Hey, what's up with the mopey mug, kid?"
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,Stan! You gotta help me! Everything you taught me workedtoowell! I think Candy just asked me out on a date!
Roadside Attraction,Stan,He-hey!(punches Dipper's shoulder)Look at this little champion!
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,"What? No! I-I mean, Candy's great, she's sweet and she's smart, but I've never thought of her likethat!Th-th-this is all moving way too fast.(sits down, panting)Okay. I just need to be honest with her and tell her I-I'm notreadyfor all this."
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"(laughs and shakes his head)Don't you see what's happening here? That's your dumb obsession with Wendy gettin' in the way of your future! If you wanna move on, you've gotta say yes to whatever comes your way.(walks toward ticket booth and looks atDarlene)Speaking of which..."
Roadside Attraction,Narration,Darlene grins at Stan.
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,But I don't wanna lead her on!
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"Ah ah ah! Watch and learn. (walks to ticket booth; searches pockets)Oh, I seem to have lost my number!(flirt-like)Can I borrowyours?"
Roadside Attraction,Darlene,(laughs)You are ariot!What brings you here? We don't normally get men this handsome around these parts.
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"Heheh. Well,(looks at name tag) Darlene,between you and me, what I'm doing here is a little secret."
Roadside Attraction,Darlene,"Oh, you seem like a man with secrets.(laughs with Stan)"
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,Ugh.
Roadside Attraction,Darlene,"You know, I'm going on a break. You wanna take the sky tram up to Widow's Peak?"
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"(whispers to Dipper)Take my advice or don't, butclearlyI know what I'm doing."
Roadside Attraction,Darlene,"(takes Stan's offered arm and walks to the entrance with him)Oh, fancy!"
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"(turns his head back to Dipper, grins, and points at Darlene)"
Roadside Attraction,Narration,Cut to Mabel and Grenda watching from the bushes as Candy and Dipper enter Mummy Town U.S.A.
Roadside Attraction,Mabel,Oh! I can't believe this is happening. A real date! I wonder what they'll name the baby.
Roadside Attraction,Grenda,"If I had a baby, I would name it Grenda 2: The Sequel!"
Roadside Attraction,Mabel,You would make such a good mother.
Roadside Attraction,Narration,"Cut to inside Mummy Town U.S.A. Dipper and Candy are sitting on a bench. A banner above them reads ""NEW MUMMIES DAILY""."
Roadside Attraction,Candy,This place is so enchanting.
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,"Sort of confused by the phrase ""New Mummies Daily,"" though. I mean, how does that even work?"
Roadside Attraction,Candy,"This mountain is full of mysteries. Like, why is my head falling on your shoulder? Beeyooop.(giggles as she places her head on Dipper's shoulder)"
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,"Uh, yep! This is what I want! This is all part of the plan and stuff."
Roadside Attraction,Corn Maze Girl,"Oh, Dipper! Hey!"
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,(gasps)Corn Maze Girl!
Roadside Attraction,Corn Maze Girl,(sits on bench)I was wondering when you'd call.
Roadside Attraction,Candy,"Dipper, who is this?"
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,"Nobody! I mean, uh,somebody,but--"
Roadside Attraction,Emma Sue,"Dipper!(walks up)I didn't recognize you right-side up. You'll never guess where my mom gave birth. Hey, who are these girls?"
Roadside Attraction,Log Land Girl,Dipper?(appears from behind the corner)Why haven't you called? Did our romantic log ride mean nothing to you?
Roadside Attraction,Candy,I can't believe it. You agreed to go on a date with me and you were seeing all these other girls?
Roadside Attraction,Corn Maze Girl,"Well, answer us. Which one of usdoyou like?"
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,"I...(begins to sweat)I like all of you! I mean, I don't like any of you! I mean--(pulls hat over face)I was trying to learn how to talk to girls!(laughs awkwardly)"
Roadside Attraction,Narration,"Emma Sue, Log Land Girl, and Corn Maze Girl walk away in disgust."
Roadside Attraction,Log Land Girl,Unbelievable.
Roadside Attraction,Emma Sue,So gross.
Roadside Attraction,Corn Maze Girl,What a jerk.
Roadside Attraction,Candy,Dipper Pines.(takes off glasses and rubs eyes)I thought you were a nice guy. But I guess you only care about yourself.(Puts on glasses and walks away)
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,"Uh, Candy, wait! Ugh, I messed everything up. I gotta find Stan! He'll know what to do!(runs away)"
Roadside Attraction,Narration,Stan and Darlene move to sit at a bench near the Giant Spider Forest.
Roadside Attraction,Darlene,"Oh, are you sure you wanna go this deep into the forest? It's soscaaary."
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"Heh, don't worry, toots.(puts arm around Darlene)That spider people stuff is just an urban legend. I can't believe people fall for it."
Roadside Attraction,Darlene,You're so brave.
Roadside Attraction,Stan,What can I say? I'm a real catch.
Roadside Attraction,Darlene,Yes.(blinks as her eyes turn black and her voice distorts)The catch of the day.
Roadside Attraction,Narration,"The view pans up as Darlene changes in size, stopping on a giant statue of a spider."
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"Uh, I think your contacts fell out--(screams)"
Roadside Attraction,Narration,Cut back to the Mystery Mountain entrance. Dipper runs to the information stand.
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,"(panting)Uh, have you seen an old guy around here? Uh, big ears, orange nose, a real know-it-all?"
Roadside Attraction,Mystery Mountain Worker,(points to a Fire Retardant Raccoon animatronic)
Roadside Attraction,Fire Retardant Raccoon,"Ah, ah, ah! Flame Retardant Raccoon says: don't hug forest fires."
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,"Ughhh.(walks to entrance)Stan, where are you? I need your advice!(hears static from the walkie-talkie and takes it out)Grunkle Stan?!"
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"(from walkie-talkie:)Heeey, buddy boy. So remember how we were talking about my technique? Well, sometimes it leads to unexpected consequences."
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,"Yeah, you can say that again. Whereareyou?"
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"The good news is, I've solved the mystery of where Oregon's mummies come from. The bad news is..."
Roadside Attraction,Narration,"(Cuts to Stan in a cave, trapped in spider silk and hanging from the ceiling right-side up. He has the walkie-talkie lodged in-between his shoulder and his head.)"
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"...I'm about to become one. Turns out Darlene is one of those spider people. But beyond that, the date's been okay."
Roadside Attraction,Narration,(Cut back to the Mystery Mountain entrance.)
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,"Wait, wait, wait. Darlene's a spider person?! How is thatpossible?"
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"(in cave:)I don't know. One minute we're having the perfect date, and the next minute she's growing extra legs and encasing me in webbing.Women,right?"
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,(at entrance:)You couldn't tell she was a spider?!
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"(in cave:)I was blinded by flattery! Also, this acid she spit in my face. I'm up the mountain at Widow's Peak."
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,"(at entrance:)Alright, I'm gonna find you. Stay put!"
Roadside Attraction,Stan,(in cave:)...You got it.
Roadside Attraction,Narration,"Darlene shoots a string of webbing at Stan's walkie-talkie, bringing it to her. She walks toward Stan, half-spider in appearance."
Roadside Attraction,Darlene,"Ah, aaaah! Trying to escape?(throws walkie-talkie, breaking it)"
Roadside Attraction,Stan,You tricked me! I'm 80% certain you don't really love me at all!
Roadside Attraction,Darlene,"Hah! Men will fall for anything.(sing-song)You sofunny,greatstory,Ilovea man with shoulder hair!"
Roadside Attraction,Stan,You--you didn't mean it about my shoulder hair?!
Roadside Attraction,Darlene,"(moves right next to Stan)Tell me, Stan. Before I transformed, who'd you think was in charge? You, with your cheesy lines and ""fake confidence?""(walks away) I'mthe master pickup artist here. Sorry, toots! This time,you'regetting used foryourbody! Which, to my weird species, is food. Allow me to slip into something more horrifying."
Roadside Attraction,Narration,"Darlene uses her legs to pull her mouth open and over the rest of her skin, folding up her human appearance and revealing the true spider underneath."
Roadside Attraction,Stan,(screams)
Roadside Attraction,Darlene,I wonder what beverage pairs well with a vintage 70-something year old man?(walks away into the cave)Be right baaaack!(laughs evilly)
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"(frantically)Come on, Dipper, where are you?"
Roadside Attraction,Narration,"Cut to Mabel, Candy, and Grenda sitting at the Stump Bench."
Roadside Attraction,Candy,I feel like such a fool. I should have known to guard my heart in a cage of ice.
Roadside Attraction,Grenda,"There, there! Let my calming voicesoothe you!"
Roadside Attraction,Candy,It is helping.
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,"(runs on-screen, panting)Girls! There you are."
Roadside Attraction,Mabel,Betrayer!
Roadside Attraction,Candy,"Oh, you. What do you want?"
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,I need your help.
Roadside Attraction,Candy,"With what, some sick jealousy trap?(high-fives Mabel)"
Roadside Attraction,Mabel,"Yeah, sing it, Candy!"
Roadside Attraction,Grenda,Testify!
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,"Look, I'm so sorry about everything. But Stan's in trouble! You can totally kill me later, but right now he needs us. I'll explain on the way.(runs off-screen, with the girls following him)"
Roadside Attraction,Narration,"(The kids walk up the trail, with Old Reliable going off in the background. They go past the Trambience as well. Cut to back in the cave.)"
Roadside Attraction,Darlene,"(off-screen:)Doo, do-doo, doo..."
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"(praying)Please. I don't know if you're really up there or not, but if you are, please save me, Paul Bunyan!"
Roadside Attraction,Grenda,(off-screen:)Mr. Pines!
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"Whoa, did that really work?(turns to see the kids running into the cave)"
Roadside Attraction,Grenda,"(yells as she tears up the silk holding Stan in place, making him fall to the ground)"
Roadside Attraction,Stan,Quick! Before the rest of the venom sets in!
Roadside Attraction,Narration,"The kids tear the webbing off of Stan. They all run out of the cave, with Darlene at the entrance."
Roadside Attraction,Darlene,No! Where are you?(runs after Stan)
Roadside Attraction,Candy,The sky tram! Everybody on! I have a plan!
Roadside Attraction,Narration,The gang hops onto one of the trams on the Trambience.
Roadside Attraction,Mabel,"Haha, yes!"
Roadside Attraction,Grenda,Perfect!
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"Ride like the wind, sky tram!"
Roadside Attraction,Narration,The tram is moving very slowly. A voice plays inside the tram.
Roadside Attraction,Recording,"Welcome to Trambience, the world's slowest treetop tram ride. Enjoy the sights at 0.1 miles per hour."
Roadside Attraction,Grenda,"(groans)Move, move,move! (begins stomping the floor with her feet)"
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,"Ugh, can't this thing go any faster?"
Roadside Attraction,Recording,No it can't. This is Trambience.
Roadside Attraction,Narration,Darlene climbs up a pole holding the trams and looks for Stan's tram. She jumps down on several trams as she searches for it.
Roadside Attraction,Recording,Enjoying the view?(a loud bang is heard on top of the tram)Take a picture!
Roadside Attraction,Narration,"Darlene's head appears in the window, causing everyone to panic. She begins coating the tram in webbing."
Roadside Attraction,Stan,We're doomed!
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,We're all gonna die!
Roadside Attraction,Candy,(begins reading pamphlet)Listen carefully! This sky tram has an emergency drop switch. Below us is Oregon's largest Paul Bunyan statue! And Old Reliable goes off in 5...(looks at watch)4...(grabs emergency drop switch)
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,"Candy, wait! Don't pull that lever!(Candy keeps counting down)"
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"Kid, are you crazy?!"
Roadside Attraction,Candy,Now!(pulls switch)
Roadside Attraction,Narration,"The tram is disconnected from the rail, sending it and Darlene down to the ground. An Old Reliable goes off, pushing the tram into the air. It bounces and rolls across Mystery Mountain, barreling through the ticket booth below the Paul Bunyan statue. Darlene is severed from the webbing and lies beneath the statue as its foot crashes down on her. She struggles to break free."
Roadside Attraction,Darlene,My only weakness! A giant boot! A giant newspaper or a giant cup would've also been pretty bad.
Roadside Attraction,Narration,The door to the tram is pushed open. The gang stumbles out.
Roadside Attraction,Recording,"Thank you for riding Trambience sky tram! Tell your friends it was a boring, boring ride."
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"(to Candy:)Kid, that was ingenious! How'd you know that would work?"
Roadside Attraction,Candy,Useless travel pamphlets.
Roadside Attraction,Darlene,"(weak)Staaaannnyyy...(she pulls her human head back on)I'm sorry. I dunno what came over me. You'll let me out, right?"
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"What?! After all that? Seriously, do I look like an amnesiac?"
Roadside Attraction,Darlene,(laughs)You're so funny. Have you ever considered becoming a comedian?
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"You know, I actually have. Comedy is too subtle these days. My style involves more over-sized props.(walks to Darlene)Here, let me get you out from there--"
Roadside Attraction,Narration,The kids pull Stan away from Darlene as she turns back into a spider and reaches out to bite him.
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"Oh, yeah. Right."
Roadside Attraction,Darlene,"You win this round, Stan! But mark my words, as long as there's men like you out there, with their dumb one-liners and pickup moves, I'll never run out of prey!(spits acid at Stan's feet)"
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"Aah! Get the car, get the car!"
Roadside Attraction,Narration,The gang runs into the RV and drives away from Mystery Mountain. They get ready to go back to the Mystery Shack.
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,(sighs and wipes the girls' numbers off of his arm)
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"(sighs)Alright, kid. I gotta admit something. I'm no expert on women. Truth is, I've been divorced once, and slapped more times than I can remember. Confidence can buy you a lot, but at the end of the day, pickup artists tend to get our heads bitten off. When it comes to women, I'm a failure."
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,"Hey.(points to arm)We're both failures. You know, even if your dating tips were bad, I actually haven't thought about Wendy all day. Plus, you did teach me to be more confident. I guess I just need to learn to use that power for good.(walks over to Candy, who is staring out the window)Hey. I found a pamphlet I don't think you've read yet.(hands Candy ""A Loser's Attempt At An Apology"")"
Roadside Attraction,Candy,"(Reads the pamphlet and smiles)It's okay, Dipper. The open road makes people do crazy things. Plus, after seeing you flee that spider like a baby, I kind of lost interest."
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,Yep! Yep. I deserve that.
Roadside Attraction,Narration,The RV entersGravity Falls. The kids cheer.
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,I still feel a little bad about wrecking those tourist traps.
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"Ah, come on. Everyone loves my pranks! And the best part is, I never have to face any consequen--SWEET LORD!"
Roadside Attraction,Narration,Stan stops the RV and gets out to see the owners of the tourist traps he pranked ruining the Mystery Shack.
Roadside Attraction,Stan,"Aw, come on!"
Roadside Attraction,Narration,A Corn Maze worker runs up and smashes one of the RV's headlights with a baseball bat.
Roadside Attraction,Corn Maze Worker,That's what you get!That's what you get! (runs away with the other tourist trap owners)
Roadside Attraction,Stan,I don't understand. I completely don't deserve this.
Roadside Attraction,Dipper,"Oh, man. Are we gonna have to help clean this up?"
Roadside Attraction,Mabel,"Nah, I'm sure Soos will take care of it. Where is Soos, anyway?"
Roadside Attraction,Narration,Credits: Soos is still in the Corn Maze.
Roadside Attraction,Soos,"Okay, Soos. Remember what yourgrandmataught you. When you get lost, stay exactly where you are, anddon't move. (pause) Don't...move...! (pause)You know, I would make a really good scarecrow."
Roadside Attraction,Narration,End.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Narration,Episode opens withDippersleeping.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper Pines,(Wakes up and screams)
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel Pines,"(As Mr. Upside-Downington:)Mornin', Dipper, guess who!"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,"Oh, what joy. If it isn't Mr. Upside-Downington. How long's it been? Third grade, maybe?"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,That's right. And I'm here to deliver you an upside-downington-tastic message!
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,Is it the message that we're getting too old for this sort of thing?
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,"(Normal voice:)Um, kinda, actually. It's that we are exactly one week away from our 13th birthday!"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,Whoa! Our birthday's coming up already?(Gasps)Soon we're gonna be actual teenagers!
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,Finally! I can stop reading preteen magazines and start readingpost-preteen magazines.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,"PG-13 movies, here I come!"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,"And just one more year until high school. High school, Dipper! Where girls become women and they teach us stuff about...(Turns Dipper around and whispers:)You know what."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,Trigonometry?
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,"Oh yeah, baby!"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Narration,Stan PinesandSoos Ramirezenter the room.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Stan,That's not the only good news coming up! In one week my senior citizen's ponytail kit is coming in the mail. I'm...I'm kinda going through some things.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Soos,"In one week, mygrandmais finally letting me eat crackers on my bed! The future is coming for us all, dudes."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Stan,The future.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,The future!
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,The future!
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,"(Laughs)I'm sorry, I can't take you seriously with that face on your chin."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,"(As Mr. Upside-Downington:)What face, Dipper?"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,You're--You're doing the voice so you obviously know what I'm talking about--
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,Bi bon't bnow bhat bou're balking about.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper and Mabel,(Laugh)
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,There is something wrong with you.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,There's something wrong with both of us.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Narration,Cut totheme song. Cut to the living room of theMystery Shack.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,"Alright, party planners. In one week we become teenagers, and our summer vacation winds to an end. So we need to throw the greatest party of all time! I'm talking piñatas with tinier piñatas inside."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Soos,"Boom, dreams comin' true!(Pours little piñatas into a large piñata)"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,"I'm talking inviting everyone in town. Let's see, where do we stand with thegnomes?"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Stan,"Not so fast, goofus and girl-goofus.(Walks into the room)After thatzombie incident, no one's throwing another party at my house. I keep finding little bits of theundeadin the couch cushions.(Finds an arm under the chair cushion)"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,"But Grunkle Stan, we need some roof to raise."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Soos,"Dude, you could rent out theGravity Falls High Schoolgym, and have your party there. That place is empty all summer long."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,"The gym's a great idea, Soos. To the high school!"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Narration,"The entire house quakes, startling everyone."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford Pines,"(Off screen)Dipper, my face is on fire!"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,"I'll just be a sec.(Runs into Ford's room)Great-uncle Ford, are you okay?"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,"(Wiping off his face, which is smoking, with a towel)Oh yes, I'm fine. I just said that to make sure you'd come in here quickly."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,But your faceison fire.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,"Yes, it's much faster than shaving. Now, listen, Dipper. I have a very important mission, and you are the only one who can help me.(Pulls out the rift)Remember theriftin dimensional space-time I showed you? It's cracking.(Points at crack)This is whatBillhas been waiting for. If it breaks, it will cause reality as we know it to completely unravel. A hypothetical and catastrophic event I callWeirdmageddon."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Narration,"Dipper stares at a blackboard Ford has drawn up, detailing the finer points of Weirdmageddon."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,"Bill is out there, and he'd use any trick, from deception to outright possession, to make this happen. But for the sake of humanity, we mustn't let it."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,What do we do?
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,We patch the rift. I'll explain on the way.(Locks the rift in a protective case)
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,"Wait, what about Mabel?"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,"(Standing in the doorway)It's okay, Dipper. You should totally go with Grunkle Ford to save the world or whatever."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,Are you sure?
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,"We're going to be doing birthday junk all week. Plus, I packed us walky-talkies. Here's one for my party mission, and one for your smarty mission.(Laughs with Dipper)"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,"(Clears throat)I did mention that the fate of the universe is at stake, didn't I? Hurry, we haven't much time.(Leaves)"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,"Okay, Dipper. It's your first big mission with Ford. A chance to prove yourself. Don't mess this up.(Runs and hits the wall)Ow! Ah, heh heh, I'm alright.(Laughs, then runs out and trips)Ahh!"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Narration,"Cut to Gravity Falls High School, whereNateandLeeare messing with its sign, which says ""SAWDUST INHALATION DRILL- 8:00. GO FIGHTING BEAVERS."" Mabel and Soos walk inside to see the gym filled with students."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,"Whoa, Soos, I thought you said this place was empty."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Wendy Corduroy,"My dawgs, what up?"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,"Wendy, what are you doing here?"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Wendy,"Ugh, high school registration."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,"Ooh! You know I'm only a year away from high school myself. Would you say your experience is more rom-com, or wacky romp?"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Wendy,"More like teen horror movie. High school is the worst. Classes get super hard, your body just flat out turns against you, and worst of all, everybody hates you."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Narration,"Cut to two girls growling at each other, then pan to Thompson and Robbie."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Thompson,Can't do it! Can't do another year!
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Robbie Valentino,My hormones are like a sweaty cage!(Punches bulletin board)
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,Why aren't they singing about following their dreams? TV taught me that high school was like some sort of musical.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Wendy,"TV lied, man! If you could avoid growing up, do it. I'd give anything to be 12 again. Anyway, what are you guys doing here?"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,"(Chuckles, sadly:)Oh, just looking for a place to have my 13th birthday party."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Teacher,Wendy...Borduroy? I-I mean Corduroy?
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Narration,All the students laugh at Wendy.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Wendy,(Blushes red)See what I mean?(walks to teacher)
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,"(Exits the gym; on the walkie talkie:)Master Mabel to Dippidy Dog. We can have our party at the gym, but we gotta talk about high school. I'm starting to think it might not be the awesome future we were expecting. Over."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,"(On the walkie talkie:)I'm going through a bad patch, Mabel. We'll talk when I get back."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,"Dipper? Come in, come in?"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Soos,"Hey, I know what'll make you feel better. Let's deliver some invites to your friends, huh?"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,Yeah!
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Narration,"Mabel and Soos drive away. Mabel finds that the sign now reads ""NO ESCAPE."" Cut to Dipper and Ford walking to the Floating Cliffs."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,"(To the walkie talkie:)Mabel? Mabel, you there? Ugh."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,"Listen, Dipper. In order to seal the rift for good, it's going to take anadhesivestronger than anything on earth. Something...extraterrestrial in origin."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,W-What do you mean?
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,"Dipper, look at the peculiar shape made by those cliffs. Does it remind you of anything?"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,Hmm...
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,(Jingles his UFO key chain and holds it up over the cliffs)
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,(Gasps quietly)Shut. Up.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,"According to my research, the entire valley ofGravity Fallswas formed when anextraterrestrial objectcrash-landed here millions of years ago. Did this craft cause the town's strange properties? Or, did the town's strange properties attract the craft? The answer is still unknown."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,"But, that's crazy! Where did the saucer go?"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,"Sometimes the strangest things in the world are right under our noses.(pushes rock away, revealing underground entrance)And our feet, in this particular instance. Now you might wanna stand back. Thismagnet guncan rip the fillings out of a man's mouth from 100 feet."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,(backs away a few steps as Ford detaches the opening)Whoa!
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,I used to raid this thing for parts for years. Where do you think I got the materials to build myportal?
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,You...I...words... not working for mouth.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,Now come. Take this.(throws Dipper a magnet gun)
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,"(Scrambling to catch the magnet gun)Whoa, whoa!"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,"Don't worry, I've been down here countless times; all the aliens have been dead for millions of years.(Starts climbing down but then pops up)Probably."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Narration,Dipper takes a deep breath and heads down the entrance. Cut to commercial.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,I can't believe there's been a giantUFOunder the town this whole time.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,"I wish my mind could be where yours is right now, Dipper. When confirmation of extraterrestrials still had that punch. Now it's just sort of ""eh.""McGucketand I used to come down here all the time to raid their tech and study their language."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,This is so cool!(Takes a selfie with some of the alien symbols and laughs)
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,"The substance we need to seal the rift is analien adhesive. Strong enough to keep the hull of a spacecraft together. Just one dollop of this adhesive should be enough to seal a crack in space-time. Also, if it touches you it will seal up all the orifices in your face,(cocks gun)so try to avoid that. Now, use your magnet gun and follow me. Hup!(Uses magnet gun to climb down a pillar)"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,Great-uncle Ford!
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,"Your turn! Say ""hup""! It helps!"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,"(Releases a deep breath)Okay. Just turn on magnet, leap down hole. Turn on...(fiddles with gun)C'mon already.(gun whirs to life)Magnet.(grunts as he jumps)Ah!(crashes onto the ceiling)A little help?"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Narration,Cut to Grenda's house. Mabel knocks on her front door.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Grenda,"Oh hi, Mabel! You're just in time for our 1 o'clock boy talk."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,If you think that's good...Boom! Me and Dipper's 13th birthday jam!
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Grenda,"Aw, man. Your birthday's on the last day of summer? I'm not gonna be here."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,What?
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Grenda,Mariusis flying me out to Austria to hang out in his castle or whatever that week. He's so clingy!
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,"You're gonna be out of town for my birthday? But at least you can come, right, Candy?"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Candy,"Sorry, Mabel. My parents send me to music camp this time of year. There is no escape from music camp."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,So neither of you are gonna be at my birthday party? And you won't be able to wish me goodbye at the end of the summer?
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Candy,"I'm sorry, Mabel."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Grenda,"Summer happened so fast.(Answers phone:)Ugh, Marius! Now's not the time!"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,"I think I need to radio for emotional back-up.(To walkie-talkie:)Dipper, please come in. Our party mission is going down in flames. Over.(Static on the walkie talkie; sighs)"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Narration,Cut to Dipper and Ford underground.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,"This is their storage facility. This place would've been heavily guarded, but now everything's defunct. Go ahead, flip any switch. They've all been busted for millions of years."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Narration,Dipper pushes a button and it causes apetting zooto fall down a hole.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Sprott,"(To a cow behind him:)Clara, did you eat my farm?"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Clara,(Moos)
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Narration,Cut back to Dipper and Ford.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,"The glue should be around here somewhere, so keep your eyes peeled. Dipper, let me ask you something. Have you thought much about your future?"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,"No, not really. I mean, beyond graduating high school with a high GPA so I can get accepted to a good technical college with a photography and media production minor to start my own ghost hunting show."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,"Ha, heh heh! It's like talking to a younger version of myself. If you're so sure of what you want out of life, why wait? Why put up with the drudgery of school?"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,"Heh. Trust me, I'd love to fast-forward the whole thing, but it's not like I have a choice."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,"Dipper, I've been thinking. I'm getting too old to investigate Gravity Falls on my own. I need to train an apprentice to help me fight monsters, solve mysteries, and protect this town. And I think I'd--I'd like to keep it in the family."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,What are you saying?
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,I've read your additions to myjournaland I'm impressed with your potential. What would you say to staying in Gravity Falls after the summer ends and becoming my apprentice?
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,W-what about school?
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,"Dipper, I have 12 PhDs. Your parents would be thrilled I could give you such an advanced education."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,(Sighs)There's also Mabel. She'd be all alone in California.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,Mabel will be fine on her own. She has a magnetic personality. I watched her become pen pals with the pizza delivery man in the 60 seconds he was at the door.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,"Gosh, we've never really been apart before."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,"And isn't it suffocating? Dipper, can you honestly tell me you never felt like you were meant for something more?"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,"I-I dunno. Sounds like a dream come true, but I'm not sure I have what it takes. I was tricked by Bill, I was wrong about Stan's portal. Heck, I can't even operate this magnet gun right.(Turns on the magnet gun and it sucks up a piece of metal. As Dipper tries to get it free, something pink seeps out of it)"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,"Ha! Yes! Dipper, you've found the adhesive!"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,I did?!
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,"Hoho, you really did it, kid. Huddle in, let's get a picture of this.(Hears something and holds up gun)"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,"(Whispering:)Uh, Grunkle Ford, you said everything in here is dead, right?"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,Yes. Unless somehow we've reactivated the-(gasps)security system!
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Narration,Thesecurity droidsemerge.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,What do we do?!
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,Listen to me very carefully: I've studied these; they're security droids and they detect adrenaline. You simply have to not feel any fear and they won't see you.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,What?!
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,"It's okay. I've done it before. Just take a deep breath, focus on your intellect, and control your fear."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,Huh-wha-wha-wha- that's crazy! I-
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,Follow my lead!
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,Great-uncle Ford!
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,"Focus, Dipper!"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Narration,The droid measures Ford's heartbeat and finds it to be calm. It moves on to Dipper.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,Wha- I-uh. I-I-uh...
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Narration,The droid produces a gun.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,I can't!
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,"Get down!(Tackles Dipper, dodging the flash from the gun; stands up and shoots the droid, destroying it, but Ford gets hit with a flash)"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Narration,The other droid produces arms and drags Ford toward it.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,Uh! No! Noooooo!
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,"Wait, no!(Runs after him but trips)"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,Stay back! It's too dangerous! Sealing the rift is what's important now! Take this!(Slides the rift to Dipper)
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Narration,The droid traps Ford in itself.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,"You're gonna have to do it without me! Use the adhesive! Fix the rift! Save the universe, Dipper!"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Narration,The droid flies away into the tunnels.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,"Great-uncle Ford!(Chases the droid through the tunnels)Hang on, I'm coming for you!(Puts the rift in his backpack)Don't worry! I'll get you out of there!"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Narration,The droid disappears behind a saucer-shaped door.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,Where is that thing taking you?!
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Narration,The room glows purple and some kind of map appears.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,"(Offscreen)It's an automated prison droid! And wherever it's going, I'm not coming back!"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,What?!(Gasps as the ceiling opens to outside)
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Narration,Arm carries Ford toward the opening.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,"No, no, no... don't worry, I'll think of something!(Runs after Ford)"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,Dipper! What on Earth are you doing?!
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,"(Puts duct tape around the magnet gun)Hold on, Great-uncle Ford."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Narration,The droid Ford is in hovers below the exit.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,"I'm getting you out of this, one way or another!(Tries to fire the gun but it doesn't work)Oh no!(Punches the gun, which has sparks flickering around it)"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Narration,The alien countdown appears to be at zero.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,"Come on, come on!(The gun turns on and magnets Dipper to Ford's droid)"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Narration,The droid blasts away.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,AAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Narration,"The droid breaks through a grate and is outside, flying high into the air."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,"(Hat falls off, grunting, pounds the droid)Let go of my uncle!(Screams as the droid shakes and beeps)"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Narration,"The droid, as Dipper screams, swerves around, flies through the crack in the cliff, through the waterfall and through thewater tower. The droid bumps, knocking Ford unconscious."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,"Ah! Great-uncle Ford! Okay, let's try: magnet pulse!(Turns a knob on the gun) Waaaaaaahhhh!"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Narration,"The droid crashes into the woods. Dipper is lying behind it, bruised and moaning."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,"(Gasps and runs to the droid)Oh no!(Pounding on the glass)Oh no no no no!(Opens the window and runs in to Ford, who is still unconscious)Come on, wake up, man!(Drags him out)We gotta get out of here before-"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Narration,Another droid is behind them. It begins to scan Dipper.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,"Hey, uh, I'm warning you! I have a magnet gun!"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Narration,The droid produces a large gun.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,Oh yeah!? You think you can scare me!? Do your worst! Nothing in this universe is gonna take away my uncle! So go ahead! Give me what you've got!
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Narration,"The machine measures Dipper's heartbeat, finds it normal, retracts its gun, and turns off."

Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,"Ahahaha! Oh-(coughs)Oh, I thought I was a goner, kid.(coughs)"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,"(Runs to him)Oh, are you alright? What happened?"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,(Leaning on Dipper)The- the orb didn't detect any chemical signs of fear. It- it assumed the threat was neutralized and self-disassembled. Hahaha!
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,I- I did it?
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,You did it.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,(Walks over to the droid)
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,This is what I was talking about. How many other twelve-year-olds do you think are capable of doing what you've just done.(Nods)
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Narration,"Cut to Mabel in the attic, sadly, looking at scrapbooks."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,(Sighs)
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Stan,"(Walks in)Hey, everything all right, pumpkin?"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,"Just can't believe the summer's almost over. And now that I know how awful high school's going to be, I'm in no hurry to start that train wreck."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Stan,"(Puts his arm around her shoulder)Ah, nobody likes gettin' older. But just because you're growing doesn't mean you have togrow up, you know? I mean, look at me. I'm pushin' seventy and Istilleat ice cream for dinner."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,But I don't wanna say goodbye to Gravity Falls.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Stan,"Hey, at least whatever happens after this summer, you'll still have your brother along with you through thick and thin. Not everyone can say that, you know.(Noogies her and leaves)"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,"Yeah, at least when I go home I always have Dipper.(Picks up a picture of Dipper)Good ol', reliable ol'-"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Narration,Her walkie-talkie crackles.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,"(Faint, over walkie-talkie:)Are you okay?"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,"(Faint, over walkie-talkie:)I'm fine."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,Let's get you out of there.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Narration,Cut to Dipper and Ford.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,"Listen to me, Dipper: this town is a magnet for things that are special. And that includes you and me. It brought both of us here for a purpose! Stay here with me, Dipper. Become my apprentice. Don't let anyone hold you-(coughs)"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,(Offers him his hand)I'll do it; I'm gonna stay.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,"Excellent.(Grabs Dipper's hand and climbs out of the ditch)Now who wants to save the world, apprentice?"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper and Ford,(Walk away laughing)
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Narration,Dipper's walkie-talkie makes static noises.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Narration,Cut to the attic.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,"(Comes in)Mabel! I just had the best day of my life! UFOs are real and there's one under the town and I saved Great-uncle Ford's life and- and...(Sees that Mabel is lying on her bed with her back to him, unmoving)Hey, are you okay?"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,"Tell me it's not true, Dipper. Tell me you were joking.(Holds up the walkie-talkie, which emits static)Ford's apprentice? Seriously?"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,"Look, I was thinking and... this is a huge opportunity for me."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,"(Crying)Well it's a horrible opportunityfor me!I had the worst day of my life! When we turn thirteen, the summer ends, and I have to leave everything behind. You're the only person I can count on and nowyou'releaving metoo!?"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,"Look, I've been thinking about it. I won't be gone forever, okay? I'll still visit you at home, and we'll chat online; we'll make it work."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,I don't want it to work. I just wish summer could last forever.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,"(Walks over to her and puts his arm on her)But it can't, Mabel. Look, things aren't gonna stay frozen this way. It's part of growing up. Things change. Summer ends."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,(Yells and runs away)
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,"Ah!(Falls over, as he was leaning on her)Mabel, wait! I didn't mean it like that! Mabel, come back!"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,"(Runs into the woods crying; sits under a tree, digs through the backpack)Only party chocolate can cheer me up now.(Holds up a notebook)Nerd books?(Holds up pens)Chewed up pens? Ugh, wrong backpack. It's not fair. I just wish summer could last forever.(Pulls her sweater over herself)"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Bill Cipher,(PossessingBlendin Blandin; offscreen)That might be possible!
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,Sweatertown isnotaccepting incoming calls right now.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Bill,"M-M-M-Mabel, it's me."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,What? Who said that?
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Bill,"(Walks up to her, adjusting camoflauge suit)I-I-I can help."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,The time travel guy? What are you doing here?
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Bill,"You said you don't want summer to end, right? D-did-did I hear that right?"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,Yeah... why are you asking?
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Bill,"Look, maybe it's against the rules, but you once did a favor for me, so I thought I could help you out. It's called a time bubble, and it prevents time from going forward. Summer in Gravity Falls can last as long as you want it to!"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,(Wipes up tears)R-Really? But how does it work?
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Bill,I just need you to get a little gizmo for me from your uncle.(Wristwatch displays the rift)It's something small. He won't even know it's missing.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,Huh. Maybe Dipper has something like that in his nerd-bag.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Narration,Cut to Ford in the lab. Dipper walks in.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,Let me guess: Mabel didn't take it well?
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,"I don't know, maybe I'm making the wrong decision. I need to think about this."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,"Dipper, right now we need to focus on the mission. Now come on, I've got the glue; hand me the rift and let's make history."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,(Reaches into bag and pulls out birthday flyer)What? Oh no! The RIFT!
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Narration,Cut to Mabel in the woods.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,(Pulls the rift out of the backpack)Huh. That's... odd. This it?
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Bill,"Yes, that's it! Just hand it over and I'll do my thing. Unless you're ready to leave Gravity Falls."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,Just a little more summer.(Gives it to him)
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Bill,"Oops.(Drops it and stomps on it, breaking it)"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,What?!
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Bill,"(Laughs maniacally, takes off goggles to reveal his eyes)"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Mabel,"Oh no! Wait, wait wait!"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Bill,"(Snaps fingers, making Mabel fall unconscious; leaves Blendin's body)At last! At long, long last! The gateway between worlds has opened! The eventone billion years prophesizedhas come to pass! The day has come!The world is finally mine! (Laughs maniacally as the rift tears reality into theNightmare Realm)"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Narration,"Townspeople look on, worried. Wind blows. Dipper and Ford run out of the Mystery Shack."
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Dipper,What's going on?! What is that?!
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Ford,We're too late! It's the end of the world.
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Bill,"(Rises up, cackling maniacally)"
Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future,Narration,Zoom into Bill's eye; end credits: Dipper and Mabel's birthday flyer sits on the ground as lightning crackles and screams are heard. A helicopter is heard above and the flyer blows away.
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Narration,Episode opens withBill Cipherlaughing evilly under the freedinterdimensional rift.
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Bill Cipher,"Oh, it's happening, It's finally, finally happening!(Continues laughing as what appears to be muscle fiber covers him)Physical form? Don't mind if I DO!(Is encased in a metal pyramid and vanishes)"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Blendin Blandin,"Huh?! What just happened?(AsMabel Pinesis lifted up and locked into abubblewith hershooting star symbolon it)Oh. Oh man. This is bad! This is real bad!Guys, we've got a situation!(Presses a button on his watch, causing him to vanish)"

Name's Bill! But you can call me your new lord and master for all of eternity!(Melts the statue ofNathaniel Northwest)"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,"Blubs, Durland, and Tyler",Ah!

Weirdmageddon Part 1,Narration,Bill's friends rejoice.
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Tyler,"Now see here, you unholy triangle fella. As mayor, I strongly urge you to git... git on out of here."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Lazy Susan,Yeah! Things with one eye are weird!
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Grenda Grendinator,We don't like out-of-towners!
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Manly Dan,We punch what we DON'T UNDERSTAND!!(Rips open mailbox)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Preston Northwest,"I would just like to say that as a rich capitalist I welcome your tyrannical rule. Perhaps I could be one of your, uh... horsemen of the apocalypse?"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Pacifica Northwest,Dad!
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Preston,"Not now, sweetie, the grownups are talking."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Bill,"Oh wow, that's a great offer. How 'bout instead I shuffle the functions of every hole in your face?(Snaps fingers; Preston's face becomes mixed up)"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Preston,"(Falls over, screaming as his family watches in horror)"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Bill,"(Laughs evilly as the townspeople flee, turns Durland to stone)"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Sheriff Blubs,(Picks up Durland)Durland! My precious Deputy Durland. No!
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Eye-Bat,(Takes Durland away)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Bill,It's time we do a little redecorating. I could really use acastleof some kind.(Apyramidforms in the sky)And how about somebubbles of PURE MADNESS?!(Colorful bubbles appear)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Narration,"A bubble passes throughSprott, who rips off his shirt and screams madly."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Bill,"This party never stops! Time is dead and has no meaning! Existence is upside-down and I reign supreme! WELCOME, ONE AND ALL, TOWEIRDMAGEDDON!"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Narration,The water tower roars. Cut to remixedtheme song. Cut toDipperandFord Pinesin front of theMystery Shack.
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Ford,So this is how the world ends. Not with a bang but with a... boop-boop.
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,Weirdmageddon.
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Narration,Birds caw and fly over Ford and Dipper. Various animals and creatures follow them.
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,(Gets knocked over by a deer)Agh!
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Gnome,"Move it, stretch."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Gnome,"Hey, we're scampering here!"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Ford,(Lifts Dipper back up)Theriftis shattered. Bill'sworldis spilling into ours and every minute his powers grow stronger.
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,"Mabel! The rift must have cracked inside her backpack. She must be in danger. I have to go find her.(Running, to the walkie talkie:)Mabel! Come in, Mabel! Mabel!"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Ford,"(Stops him)Dipper. Listen to me. We can find your sister soon, but first we have to stop Bill. If we can blast him back through the rip he came out of, we just might be able to stop him before his weirdness spreads across the entire globe."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,Are you sure defeating Bill is even possible?
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Ford,No. I'm not sure. But being a hero means fighting back even when it seems impossible. Will you follow me?
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,To the ends of the Earth.
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Ford,Good. Because that's where we're heading. You also might want to step inside.
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper and Ford,(Run inside)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Gnome,Weirdness wave!
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Narration,"The wave washes over the Mystery Shack and overSoos' house, causing their barbecue grill to come to life and run away."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Soos,(Looking out of window)Ah! Abuelita! A tidal wave of madness just went over us!
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Abuelita,"(Offscreen)Oh, Soos, such an imagination."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Soos,(Turns around and sees that Abuelita has transformed into a chair)Ah! You've turned into a chair!
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Abuelita,Why don't you have a seat and relax?
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Soos,But what about you? And my friends?
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Abuelita,I'll be fine. You go help the others.
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Soos,"When the universe is broken, only one handyman can fix it.(Kisses Abuelita and runs off)I'm coming for you, friends!"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Abuelita,Time for a nap.(Reclines)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Narration,Cut to Stan nailing a sign to a tree.
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Gompers,(Grabs the tassel onStan Pines' fez)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Stan Pines,Hey!
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Gompers,(Tears off the tassel and eats it)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Stan,"That's it, goat! It's time I threw you off this property for good!"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Narration,The wave comes over them and Gompers grows until he is as tall as the trees.
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Stan,"On second thought, I'm gonna run like a coward now.(Screams and runs away)"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Gompers,(Walks off)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Narration,Cut to thearcade. The wave washes over it and several video game characters break out the windows.
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Rumble McSkirmish,Ha! Freedom! Freedom to PUNCH!(Punches the air)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Narration,Cut toGravity Falls Maximum Security Prison.
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Prison Counselor,"Okay, inmates, time to review your finger paintings.(Looking at paintings)Good. Nice.(Gasps when he sees Gideon's painting, which is a torn paper with a knife in it and ""Revenge"" written on it and ""Love"" written next to a picture of Mabel; the man sighs)Gideon, does this look like someone who's ready to re-enter society?"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Ghost-Eyes,Gideon's unappreciated in his time!
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Gideon,"Oh, Ghost-Eyes, you're making me blush!"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Killbone,Gideon makes prison life worth living.
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Prisoners except Gideon,Gideon! Gideon!
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Gompers,"(Eats a bit of the ceiling, making the rest crumble down and crush the counselor)"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Prisoners,(Look outside and gasp at scene ofabnormal creatures)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Gideon,"(Looks at the three-headed bird which has landed on his hand, it then screeches)Oh my. Bill came through."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Narration,Cut to Bill and his friends downtown.
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Bill,"Ready to cause some havoc, boys?"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Bill's gang,(Laugh)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Narration,"Behind Bill, Dipper looks out the church clock tower and Ford readies his rifle."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Ford,"Ah, myquantum destabilizer. I've been waiting a long time to use this. We're only gonna have one chance to take this shot.(Aims it at Bill)Steady... steady... and..."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Narration,"The wave washes over them, making the bell come to life."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Bell,Woohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoo!! I'm alive now!
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Ford,"(Fires, but only hits Bill's hat)Oh no!!"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Bill,"(Hat regenerates)Well, well, well, and here I thought today couldn't get anybetter!(Fires a beam at the tower, destroying it)"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,"(Lying in the wreckage, bruised)Great-uncle Ford!"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Ford,"(Trapped under some wreckage, grunts)Dipper! Take my journals!(Slides the backpack to Dipper, who picks upJournal 3)Listen, I know of one other way to defeat Bill, it's-(Hears something behind him)Oh, no! Dipper! Run! Get down!"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,(Runs down the stair)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Bill,(Rises behind Ford with the six-fingered hand symbol in his eye)Good old six-fingers. I've been waiting an(Deep voice:)ETERNITY(Normal voice:)to have a chat face to face.(Lifts Ford up)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Ford,Wah!
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Bill,"Everyone, this armageddon wouldn't be possible without help from our friend here. Give him a six-fingered hand!"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Bill's gang,"(Offscreen, clap and cheer)"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,(Comes around the corner of the church)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Bill,"This brainiac is the one who builtthe portalin the first place! Ah, don't look so sour, Fordsy. It's not too late to join me. With that extra finger, you'd fit right in with my freaks."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Ford,"I'll die before I join you! I know your weakness, Bill!"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Bill,"Oh, yeah?(Eye shows a question mark)And I know a riddle. Why did the old man do this?(Assumes a pose)"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Ford,This?(Imitates Bill's pose)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Bill,"(Shoots a laser at Ford, petrifying him)"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,(Gasps)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Bill,(Picks up the petrified Ford)Because I needed a new backscratcher!(scratches himself with Ford as he and his friends share a hearty laugh over it.)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,(Growls)That'senough! (Comes out from behind building)Hand over my uncle! Or else!(Holds up Journal 3)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Bill,"Now isn't. This.(Flies up to Dipper and his eye glows white; with a deep voice along with his normal voice:)INTERESTING?(Normal voice:)My old puppetis back for an encore. You thinkyoucan stop me?(Punches the air)Go ahead, Pine Tree, show me what you've got."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,"(Flipping through 3 and shining blacklight on it)I...uh... I... uh...(Sees that the Journal says ""IF HE GAINS PHYSICAL FORM THEN ALL IS LOST!"")"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Bill,"I UM I. Do it, kid. Do somebrilliantthing that takes me down right now. Whattdya got, Pine Tree, everyone's waiting. DO IT."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,"(Jumps at Bill)Augh, BILL!(His fist hits a force field in front of Bill's eye and he is thrown backward into a tree; he rubs his head)Ugh..."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Kryptos,(Mockingly)Eww!
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Pyronica,(Laughs)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Paci-Fire,"Ha, ha, ha."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,(Reaches for Journal 3)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Bill,"(Levitates the Journals)That's right. Don't be a hero, kid.(Waves Ford)This is what happens to heroes in my world.(Burns the Journals)"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,NO!! THE JOURNALS!!
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Bill,"Not much of a threat now,areyou?(To his friends:)Now can anyone remind me why we came here?"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,8 Ball,To getweird!
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Bill,"THAT'S RIGHT! VIP party at theFearamid. Oh, and 8 Ball, Teeth, you've earned a treat, have the kid for a snack."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,Huh?
Weirdmageddon Part 1,8 Ball,(Rolls eyes)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Teeth,Heheheheh.
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Bill,"Hench-maniacs, ROLL OUT!(Turns a car into a racecar-like vehicle)"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Bill and his gang,(Get into the car)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Pyronica,"Let's get out of here, Bill!"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Bill,"(Drives away, firing lasers, changing things as he goes, laughing maniacally)"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,"(Stares at 8 Ball and Teeth, panting)"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,8 Ball,"So, you wanna eat him, or, something?"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Teeth,"Oh, definitely, let's eat him."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,Ahhhhh!!!(Runs away as they follow him)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Shandra Jimenez,"(On a television set that is lying among the wreckage)We are day three in this strange cataclysmic event, which some are calling ""Weirdmageddon,"" or the ""Oddpocalypse."" Weather today calls for black clouds, blood rain and frequent showers of Eyeball Bats turning people into stone. I'm Shandra Jimenez and I ate a rat for dinner."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Eye-Bat,(TurnsPizza Guyinto stone and carries him away)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,"(Gets out from under some garbage bag and sees an Eyeball Bat following him)Huh!(Runs into an alley; into walkie talkie:)Mabel, it's me. So far I have eluded capture but I haven't been able to find you or Stan anywhere. I don't know if you can hear me, but wherever you are, whatever happens, I'm going to find you."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Pterodactyl,"(Screeches and takes the ""A"" out of ""MALLS"" on theGravity Malls'sign)"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,The mall! Maybe they're hiding in there!(Runs to the mall and runs into the glass)Oh no!
Weirdmageddon Part 1,The Horrifying Sweaty One-Armed Monstrosity,"Hey. Hey you. Hey, I wanna talk to you. I wanna talk to you about going inside my mouth. I- I think you wanna get in here.(Crawling toward Dipper)Hey, you, hey! I'm talkin' to you, man! You don't have to make a big deal outta this! Hello! HELLO!"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,"(As he talks, forces himself through the mall's automatic doors, but gets stuck in them)"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,The Horrifying Sweaty One-Armed Monstrosity,"(Slaps the door, freeing Dipper)Why are you just ignoring me?(Reaches inside)That's seriously rude to just IGNORE someone like this."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,"(Backs into the food court)Stan! Mabel!(Sees nachos on a table)Huh, maybe at least I can get something to eat. The last nachos on Earth.(Picks them up and is trapped in a net)Ah! HELP! The nachos tricked me!"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Wendy Corduroy,(Pokes her head out from a plant)Dipper?
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,Wendy!? Oh no! You've been transformed into some sort of... tree monster!
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Wendy,"Ha! It's just camouflage. My dad made me andmy brothersdo apocalypse training every year instead of Christmas. Guess it's sort of cool their paranoia paid off.(Shoots a bat) Nice!Bat meat. Let me get that for ya.(Throws ax at the net, freeing Dipper)"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,"Ah! Wendy, I'm so glad to find you!(Hugs her)I thought everyone I knew was gone."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Wendy,"Hey, hey, it's okay. We have each other now. AndToby Determined, who I accidentally mistook for a monster."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Toby,This just in: this arrow in my shoulder.
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Wendy,"We shouldn't stay out in the open for too long. Let me show you my hideout.(Leads them to the Edgy on Purpose store, cooks the bat)We were playing Truth or Dare in the cemetary when it happened. The eyeballs frozeNate,Lee,TambryandThompson.(Presses a button on the cash register she's sitting on and takes some money to wipe her face with)Robbiealmost got away but had to pause to take a selfie. What about you?"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,I was in a fight with Mabel when it happened. Uncle Ford asked me to be his apprentice once the summer was over. But that would mean I wouldn't go back home. It would mean growing up without Mabel.
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Wendy,"Oh,dude."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,Mabel didn't take it well and she ran off into the forest. She couldn't even look me in the eye.
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Wendy,"Come on. Let's get some fresh air. Toby, you watch the camp."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Toby,"(Dressed in a bunch of the Edgy on Purpose clothes)Don't call me ""Toby"" anymore. Call me Bodacious T."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Wendy,No one will ever call you that.
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Toby,Ooh...
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Narration,Cut to Dipper and Wendy outside.
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Wendy,"End of the world. Man, those death metal album covers got it shockingly right."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,"You know, I used to think I could get out of anything, but this? The journals are destroyed, Ford is captured and I can't find my family anywhere. Bill said it himself, there's no room for heroes out here. We lost."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Wendy,"Look, dude, it's not over yet. You've beaten Bill twice before, why is this time any different?"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,'Cause then I had Mabel.
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Wendy,"Then you need to get Mabel back. Look, this summer, I've seen some amazing things, but nothing as amazing as you and your sister. I don't know if it's dumb luck or yin and yang, or whatever, but when you two work together, there's like nothing you two can't accomplish. You just need to make up, and team up, and save the universe."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,But how will I ever find her?
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Narration,"A monster eats a billboard, revealing the bubble with Mabel's shooting star on it at the cliffs."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,The shooting star from Mabel's sweater! She's in there. I know it.
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Wendy,"Whoa, it that like twin ESP?"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,"No, we don't have that, but we do have this thing where our allergies totally act up at the same time.(Sneezes)Mabel needs us. But how are we gonna get out there without being caught?"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Wendy,I have an idea.
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Narration,"Cut to the fearamid, where the party is going on."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Demons,(Spinning a stone Lazy Susan)Spin the person! Spin the person!(Lazy Susan's head points at Pyronica)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Hectorgon,Ah!(Flies away)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Pyronica,(Catches him with her tongue and swallows him)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Bill,"(Laughs)Go nuts, guys! When we're done partying, I unveil phase two."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Lolph,"(Offscreen, pounding on door)Open up! This is the police. Time Police."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Narration,The demons all look at Bill.
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Bill,"Just play it cool, ditch the time-punch. Let me do the talking."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Narration,"(The door is then destroyed, revealing the Time Paradox Avoidance Enforcement Squadron, accompanied byTime Baby, at the doorway)"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Lolph,(Steps forward)Bill Cipher. You are in violation of the rules of space-time and possessing the body of a time officer.
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Blendin,My body is a temple! How dare you!!
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Time Baby,"Hear this, Cipher!"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Bill,"Ugh, Time Baby."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Time Baby,"(Projects a hologram of the universe)If your rip in this dimension continues, it could destroy the very fabric of existence!(The universe in the hologram explodes)Surrender now or face my tantrum!"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Bill,"Oh, no, a tantrum! Whatever will I do about that-HOW 'BOUT THIS?? BOOM.(Vaporizes the Time Baby and the police; eye turns into a mouth and blows the smoke off his finger)"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Kryptos,"Ah, snap! He just killed Time Baby!"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Bill's gang,Yeahhh!(Resume partying)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Blendin,"(Hiding)Aw, man, this has gone from bad to worse! I gotta get out of time-Dodge!(Disappears)"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,8 Ball,"(Approaches with Teeth)Boss, the Pine Tree kid got away before we could eat him. Are you worried he might try to cause some trouble?"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Teeth,"Yeah, trouble with Mabel's bubble?"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Bill,Ha! I'm not worried. I've gotsomeone on the case.
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Narration,"Cut to the Bud Gleeful's auto-mart. Dipper, Toby and Wendy are looking over the fence."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Wendy,The abandoned auto-mart. Free cars right for the hot-wiring. We just found our ride to Mabel. I wonder if they have a tank. I'vealwayswanted to drive a tank!
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,I can't believe this place is just abandoned.
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Toby,"(Looking into a car)Ooh, an air freshener. Finally I'll smell like a person. Stealy stealy..."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Narration,A tranquilizer dart hits him.
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Toby,Ah! It's gonna take more than one dart to keep me from-
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Narration,Several more darts hit him and he collapses.
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Wendy,Oh no! Tony! Was it Tony? I can never remember his name.
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Narration,"Three car headlights turn on in front of them. Three giant cars, each with prisoners inside, surround them."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Prisoner,"Well, well, looks like we got ourselves a pair of ground walkers."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Prisoner 2,Heheh! Ground walkers! Heheh! Ain't got no wheels!
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Prisoners,(Laugh)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Wendy,ListenDiscount Auto Warriors!
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,We just wanna make it to that bubble out east; we have no quarrel with you!
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Gideon,"(With a voice-lowering megaphone:)Oh, but that's where you're wrong! Hands where I can see 'em."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper and Wendy,(Hold up hands)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Gideon,Y'all fellers ain't goin' nowhere.
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Wendy,"""Y'all?"""
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,"""Fellers?"" Wait... Gideon!?"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Gideon,"That's Sheriff Gideon!(Without megaphone:)Under the authority of Bill Cipher, I place you two under arrest! Oh, hi, Wendy! Have we formally met?"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Narration,"Prisoners lead Dipper and Wendy to Gideon, who is standing on the back of a truck."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Gideon,Wooooo-we! Look what the apocalypse dragged in! Y'all are in a twelve-piece bucket of deep fried trouble now! Ghost-Eyes! Spitoon!(Spits gum out into spitoon)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,"Ugh, it's Gideon."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Wendy,And he's gotten folksier.
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Gideon,"Ma' old pal Bill figured you might try to rescue Mabel. So he appointed me, master of these wastelands, andkeeper of the bubble!My sweet precious Mabel's trapped inside and I HAVE THE ONLY KEY!(Shows them a key with the shooting star symbol on it)Wrapped around my... well I wouldn't call it a neck exactly, wrapped around this little pocket of fat under ma' head?"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,"Gideon, you haveno rightto keep her in there!"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Gideon,Bill explained it to me nice and simple: she was always destined to be mine!(Takes a newspaper article from when he was dating her from his hat)And now that I have her in a cage she'll learn to love me! I have an eternity to wait! Ghost-Eyes! Ready to escort our friends to Bill's dungeon?
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Ghost-Eyes,(Picks Dipper and Wendy up)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,Uh! No! Hey!
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Wendy,"This isn't gonna work, Gideon."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Gideon,Oh? And why's that?
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Wendy,"Cause after I break Ghost-Eyes' arm and steal that key from your neck, I'm gonna wear your butt on my foot like a rhinestone slipper!"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Prisoners behind Gideon,(Laugh)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Gideon,"Oho, and what makes you think you can do all that?"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Wendy,'Cause I'm a flippin' CORDUROY!(Flips over Ghost-Eyes' arm and pulls him back)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,"(Falls on the ground and ducks, tripping Ghost-Eyes)"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper and Wendy,(Run away)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Gideon,Ghost-Eyes! My hench-angel!
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Wendy,"Ha!(Grabs Gideon and rips the key from his neck, to prisoners:)Get back! Get back! Or I will drop-kick him, I swear!(Breaks a car window and unlocks it)"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Gideon,"You'll never get away with this, ya hear me?!"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Wendy,Guess what? We already DID!(Kicks Gideon into the other prisoners)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,"(Getting into the car behind her)Wendy, you're the coolest person I know."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Wendy,"I know, dude. Tell me about it later.(Drives away)"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Gideon,After them!
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Prisoners,(Get into cars)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Ghost-Eyes,(Carrying Gideon into a car)You want your baby seat?
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Gideon,"Yes, please."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Ghost-Eyes,(Buckles him into a carseat)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Gideon,"(Over a microphone:)We are not letting 'em get Mabel! Discount Auto-mart Warriors, rollout!"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Prisoners,"(Drive away, cheering)"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,"Okay, all we have to do is outrace Gideon's henchmen, unlock the bubble, save Mabel, save the world.(Sees that Wendy had hit a mailbox)Quick question: did you ever get your driver's license?"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Wendy,Definitely not. Arm!(Swerves to avoid The Horrifying Sweaty One-Armed Monstrosity)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper and Wendy,Ah!
Weirdmageddon Part 1,The Horrifying Sweaty One-Armed Monstrosity,(Grabs one of the cars)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Prisoner inside car,Uhahhhhh!(screams this as windshield cracks)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,The Horrifying Sweaty One-Armed Monstrosity,(Eats the car)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Gideon,Swerve swerve!(Ghost-Eyes Swerves to avoid the arm)I can't let 'em free Mabel!
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Ghost-Eyes,"Remind me why you're keeping your girlfriend in a prison bubble again? Have we, the prisoners, become the wardens?"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Gideon,SHE LOVES ME! She just doesn't know it yet. Now quit the philosophy.
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Ghost-Eyes,Sorry. Itwasmy major.
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Narration,The cars drive toward some bubbles.
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Gideon,Ha! Weirdness bubbles blockin' the path! WOOOOWEE we got 'em now.
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,Watch it! Go around that bubble field!
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Wendy,No way around! Hold on! We're goin' through!
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,What's even in there?!
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper and Wendy,"(Scream as they enter a bubble, then they have the heads of birds)"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,"(Chirping, subtitled:)For some reason, I really want worms right now."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Wendy,"(Chirping, subtitled:)Eat worms! Fly south! Nest!"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Narration,The car exits the bubble and Dipper and Wendy are normal again.
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,"(Coughing up feathers)Oh, that was horrible!"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Wendy,"Here comes another one, dude! Brace yourself!(Drives through three more bubbles)"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper and Wendy,"(Screaming, they become anime-styled, then they are made out of meat products, then they become live-action)"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Gideon and Ghost-Eyes,"(Screaming, they become made of 3D blocks, female versions of themselves in dresses and make-up, and old-fashioned silent cartoon versions of themselves, a card comes up that says:)""AAAAAAAAAUGH!"""
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Narration,"Both the cars are back to normal. Ghost-Eyes slams his truck against Wendy's car, breaking the glass."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Wendy,Ah!
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,"Wendy, we're almost there! We just have to make that jump!"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Wendy,"Total lack of driver's training, don't fail me now.(Accelerates and drives off the cliff, screaming as the car flies through the air)"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Narration,"The car hits the ground and rolls. When it stops, the passenger door opens and Dipper falls out."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,So... close.(Crawling)Mabel... I'm... almost there.(Stops in front of a figure in a cloak)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Soos,"(Offers him his hand and pulls back his hood)Heya, Dipper. How's it hanging?"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,Soos!
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Wendy,"(Stands up from behind the car, bruised)Soos?"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Soos,"Handyman of the apocalypse, at your service."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,"Soos! How'd you, where'd you-?"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Soos,"I've been wandering the plains like a desperado, helping strangers. I guess there's some folk songs about me now?(Looking at Wendy's arm)Let me see what the damage is, here. Ah, well the good news is: your arm is okay."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,So what's the bad news?
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Soos,"Bad news is we're surrounded, dudes."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Narration,"The prisoners have surrounded them, cheering."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Gideon,"Wooowee. I dare say y'all almost had the jump on me there for a second. But this ain't yourGravity Fallsanymore! Out here, I win.(Claps and gets thrown a conch, which he blows)Bill's henchbats will be here any minute to retrieve y'all. MABEL'S MINE NOW! Hahahaha!"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,Is she?
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Gideon,"Well, yeah. I have her trapped, ergo, Mabel is MINE!"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,"Gideon, listen to me, if I've learned anything this summer it's that you can't force someone to love you.(Looking at Wendy)The best you can do is strive to be someone worthy of loving."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Gideon,"Oh, I'm worthy o' lovin'! These prisoners love me!"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Prisoners except Gideon,(Cheer)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,"But Mabel doesn't. Because you're selfish. But you can change! Bill thinks there's no heroes in this world, but if we work together and fight back, wecandefeat him. You wanna be Mabel's hero? Stand up to Bill, and let us save her!"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Gideon,That's crazy! You know what Bill would do to me if that happens?
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Ghost-Eyes,"What, you scared of Bill?"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Gideon,"No, I ju... it's a complicated situation."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,"Look inside, Gideon. If all this is for Mabel, then ask yourself what Mabel would want you to do."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Gideon,"(Looks at the newspaper article, looks at the picture of him and Mabel together, with him smiling and Mabel looking unconformable, quietly:)Dipper. Will you tell her what I did?"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,Of course.
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Gideon,"I hope you're right about this.(To the prisoners:)Guys, new plan! Bill's minions are gonna be on us in seconds. But I'm not gonna let that dumb triangle be the warden o' me! Y'all ready for a good old fashioned prison brawl?"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Ghost-Eyes,"We're behind you for life, brother!"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Prisoner,"Fighting children is boring, but fighting a chaos god sounds fun!"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Gideon,"Lets do this!(As the prisoners drive toward the fearamid)Henchmen, rollout!"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Prisoners,(Cheer)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Soos,Whew! And I thought I was gonna have to throw down!
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Narration,"Cut to Dipper, Soos and Wendy in front of Mabel's bubble."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,"Okay, remember, guys. This is a prison bubble designedbyBill. We've got to prepare ourselves for what we find in here."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Soos,"Whatever it is, we'll do it together. For Mabel!(Puts his hand in the center)"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Wendy,(Puts her hand on top of his)For Mabel!
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Dipper,(Puts his hand on top of theirs)For Mabel.(Unlocks the padlock and the chains fall to the ground)
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Narration,"Dipper, Soos and Wendy hold hands and enter the bubble. The screen fades to white and ""TO BE CONTINUED"" appears on the screen. Credits: cut to The Horrifying Sweaty One-Armed Monstrosity downtown."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,The Horrifying Sweaty One-Armed Monstrosity,"Anybody wanna get in my mouth? I'm a big mo—hungry monster—I'm a big hungry monster here! I would really appreciate it, if someone—you, ma'am, you ma'am, how would you like to get in my—"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Woman,"(Offscreen, screams)"
Weirdmageddon Part 1,The Horrifying Sweaty One-Armed Monstrosity,"Anybod- hello! Hey, hey, sir, sir! Eh, false alarm. It's just a bird. Not one person. Not one person has... gotten in my mouth. I don't care anymore. I just...(Sighs, begins to crawl away)I gotta call my mother."
Weirdmageddon Part 1,Narration,End.
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Narration,Opens to a squirrel scampering before being eaten by a mailbox.
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Sprott,"End times are here, folks. Only way to salvation is to embrace the triangular ways of our overlord. Any object with more than three sides is sinful.(Manly Danholds up a triangular section of a stop sign that he cut)That's it. That's probably whatBillwants."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Narration,AnEye-Batcomes and Manly Dan screams as he is turned to stone.
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Sprott,I reckon I've been livin' a lie.(Screams as he is turned to stone and then carried away by the Eye-Bat)
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Narration,Cut to theFearamid. Bill Cipher taps a fork on the still-petrifiedFord Pinesand the music stops.
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Bill Cipher,"Ladies, gentlemen, that creature with like eighty-seven different faces."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Creature with 88 different faces,Eighty-eight different faces!
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Bill,"Whoa-ho, sorry - touchy subject. Anyways, it's been fun turningGravity Fallsinside out, rounding up all its terrified citizens and then stacking them into this massivethroneof frozen human agony. (The last word echoes; sits on the throne)Don't worry, they're not conscious anymore. Probably."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Lazy Susan,"(Tranquilizes)Uh, my omelettes. They-they have friendly faces."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Bill,"Whoops. Hehe, back, back you go there.(Pokes Lazy Susan back into place and she turns back to stone)But Gravity Falls is just the beginning. It's time to take our chaos worldwide! Alright boys, to the corners of the Earth. Set the world aflame with your weirdness. This dimension is ours!(Bill's friends come out of the Fearamid)Ah, global domination. I could get used to...(the demons hit something invisible to the naked eye and fall down)WHAT??!!!(Goes out to investigate and pokes what his friends hit; the shot pans out to show that the whole town is surrounded by an invisible forcefield, containing the rift and Bill's chaos)Hmm, this might be more complicated than I thought."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Paci-Fire,I think I broke something.
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Bill,Walk it off!
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Narration,"Cut to the shortenedWeirdmageddontheme song. Scene opens on thePrison Bubbleand zooms in, showingDipper Pines,Soos RamirezandWendy Corduroyinside the bubble."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,"Mabel! Mabel! Okay guys, Bill has taken over the town and if his weirdness spreads he's gonna take over the whole world. Our first step to stopping him is rescuing Mabel, but he's got her trapped in this strange prison bubble."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Wendy,Whatisthis place anyway?
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Narration,"The ground starts cracking with rainbow-colored fractures; Soos, Dipper and Wendy scream as they fall."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Soos,"Guys, if I die, I wanna die hugging.(Grabs Dipper and Wendy in a hug)"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,"Soos, you're choking me."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Soos,Let my body be your shield!
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Narration,Continued screaming until the three land on a bouncy-house.
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,Huh? Is the entire ground a bouncy castle?
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Wendy,Do you hear '80s music?
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Soos,And does the air smell like childlike wonder?
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,"Dipper, Wendy and Soos",(Look out at Mabeland)Whoa.
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,This is Mabel's prison?
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Unnamed boy in green,"(Holding up Mabel's letter with every box checked, excitedly:)Yes. Definitely. Absolutely."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Announcer,"It's fun-o'clock everyone. Today's weather calls for rainbows with a chance of dance parties. If you are the owner of a unicorn with a top hat, please come to the ice cream beach. Your unicorn is being towed."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Soos,"What is this new world? Shining, shimmering, splendid."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Narration,A pineapple runs screaming asXyler and Crazdrive up and almost run it over while a hippopotamus jumps through a nearby window.
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Craz,Welcome to Mabeland.
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,And this is worse than the apocalypse.
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Wendy,"Dude, this place hurts my eyes."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Xyler,Oh that's normal. Mabeland's rainbows have colors only bees and art students can see. Now who wants to go on the grand tour?
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,Do we have a choice?
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Xyler and Craz,No!
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Narration,"They begin driving with Dipper, Soos and Wendy in the car."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Xyler,Mabeland is the ultimate paradise and the only rule: there are no rules.
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Craz,"Except for one rule which is very serious. But no one would ever break it, so it's not worth mentioning."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Xyler and Craz,Yeah!
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,"Listen creepy dream guys, we're not here to party, okay? We just need to find Mabel and get her out of here. Where is she?"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Craz,"Our home girl Mabel lives at our next stop.(The car crashes through a building, hits a fire hydrant, and skids through the street)"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Xyler,No rules!
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Narration,They arrive at a beach.
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Xyler,"Now, come have rad snacks served by awesome penguins."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Narration,Penguins walk up with trays full of food and drinks.
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Wendy,"(Takes a drink)Oh, score! I'm so hungry."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Soos,"(Takes a drink)Yeah, I haven't eaten anything except for part of my hat for the last three days."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Soos and Wendy,(Clink cups)
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Wendy,Hah!
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,"Can you guys just hold on a second? Do you see what's happening here? Don't forget this world was created byBill.(Slaps Soos' drink away as he is about to drink from it)That punch is probably blood! And that glitter rain(A cloud of glitter appears over him)is probably ground up bones, or babies, or something.(Collects some glitter in his hand and drops it)Bill's using Mabel's own fantasies as some sick trap. We need to grab Mabel and get the heck out of here."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Craz,"Oh, Mabel? She's at the top of the tallest tower guarded by those big buff waffle guards."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Xyler,There's no way to get past them!
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Soos,Someone hand me some syrup.(Jumps on a guard from behind and starts to eat him)
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Guard,Aaah! It's happening! The moment we've trained for!
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Guard 2,"Oh, don't worry, man! I've got ya-(Screams as face is punched out by Wendy)"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Wendy,"It's now or never, guys!"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Narration,"Cut to the inside of the tower, where several animals are frolicking."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,"Dipper, Soos and Wendy",(Punch open the doors)
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,This is a rescue! Everyone hit the deck!
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Soos,"(Picks up one of the animals and throws it, then follows Dipper and Wendy up the stairs)Hang in there, Mabel!"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,"Dipper, Soos and Wendy",(Burst through the doors to the bedroom)
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,"There she is! Soos! Grab her! Wendy, barricade the door!(Wendy does so)"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Soos,"(Picks up Mabel, who is sleeping)Up you go, little lady."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Mabel,(Wakes up)Soos? Wendy? Dipper?
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Wendy,(As swords are being poked through the door)The waffles are coming back! We gotta hurry!
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Mabel,"Uh, guys?"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,"Don't worry, Mabel, we'll get you out of this!"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Mabel,"But, Dipper!(Claps twice and lifts everything in front of the door off the ground. She puts everything down in order and seats Dipper, Soos and Wendy on some chairs - the guards come in and point their spears at them; she claps and they stop)"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,Mabel! What are you doing? We're trying to save you from this prison!
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Mabel,"This isn't a prison! I made this world!(Claps and the lights come on)Well, I sort of woke up here. It's complicated."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,What are you saying?
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Mabel,"(Reveals a plaque that says ""MAYOR MABEL"")I'm saying this is my home now. And I don't want to be saved!"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Bubble Bear,"(Flies into the window and bumps the windowpane)Sorry, Mabel."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Mabel,"No worries, Bubble Bear."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Narration,Commercial break.
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,You didwhat?!
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Mabel,"Look, after you said you wouldn't come back home with me at the end of the summer for your ""apprenticeship,"" I wanted to hide in my sweater forever. But then I woke up in a place that gives me exactly what I wanted: an endless summer where we'll never have to grow up! Here the sun shines all day, the party never ends, and now that you guys are here, it's finally perfect!"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,"Listen, Mabel, we're not here to party. All of this is crazy!"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Mabel,"Ugghh. I figuredyoumight say something like that, Dipper. That's why I prepared a backup Dipper with a more supportive attitude."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dippy Fresh,"(Rides in on a skateboard)Wohoho!(High fives Mabel)Yeah! Wiggity-wiggity-what's up, dude-bros? I'm Dippy Fresh! I like skateboarding, supporting my sister, and punctuating every sentence with a high five! Hup!(Holds up hand)"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Soos,Oh! Don't mind if I-
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,(Clears throat)
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Soos,"I'm sorry, I can't leave him hanging! Yus!(High fives Dippy Fresh)"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,"You're dead to me, Soos."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Mabel,"Trust me, you guys are gonna love it here. This world always knows what you want. Sometimes even before you do!(A chinchilla drops into her arms)Apparently I wanted a chinchilla! Right again, Mabeland!"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,"Mabel, listen to yourself. This is crazy! I'm sorry about our fight, and I'm sorry things aren't great right now but that doesn't mean you can just stay in here forever!"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dippy Fresh,"Hey, take a chill pill! Those grow on trees here!"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,"YOU STAY OUT OF THIS, DIPPY FRESH!"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Soos,"Dude, calm down. Dippy Fresh didn't do anything to you, dawg."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,(Growls at Dippy Fresh)
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Mabel,"I know it sounds too good to be true, but just give this place a chance! Mabeland knows just what you want and always provides!(Claps and Dipper, Soos and Wendy's clothes go back to normal. A flying hamburger goes up to Soos)"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Soos,(Bites it)Pudding center. Nice!
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Wendy,"Uh, actually, Mabel, I'm with Dipper on this. Gravity Falls is in trouble, and I really think-"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Thompson,(Honks horn and drives up with Wendy's friends in a monster truck)
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,"Thompson,Tambry,LeeandNate",Wendy!
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Wendy,Wha- guys? You're safe!
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Lee,"We've got a monster truck full of fireworks, fake IDs, and pranking supplies."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Nate,Wanna drive this truck to the high school and glue this plunger to the principal's head?
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Wendy,"(Eyes sparkling)Yes. Yes, I do. Sorry, guys, I've always wanted to do that. I'll be back in just a few minutes.(Gets in truck)"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Teens,"(Drive away, cheering)"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,Wendy?!
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Soos,"Don't worry, dude. There's nothing in this world that could break me from our mission."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Narration,"A muscular man with a wrestling mask and a champion belt that says ""PAPI"" enters."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Ernesto,"Soos, mijo. I have returned."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Soos,"Holy- whoa, whoa. Dad?"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Ernesto,"You don't remember what I look like, so I have the body of a pro wrestler and a face you once saw on a hot sauce bottle. I was never there for you, but in this world, I can be."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Soos,You're perfect!
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,"It's a trap! Don't go with him, Soos! No matter what he offers you!"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Ernesto,(Holds up ball and baseball glove)Want to play catch?
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Soos,"I'm sorry, dude. Even if it is all a dream, I've gotta play just one game. Hahaha! Come on, Dad!(Chases the ball his ""dad"" throws)"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,"(To Mabel:)Okay, this has gone too far! You can't honestly think these fantasies are good for anyone!"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Mabel,"You can't argue with the results: people are happy here! Does it really matter if it's real or not? For once, stop listening to your head and listen to your heart. Mabeland has something for everyone! Even you! In fact:(A door begins to open)"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,Nope. Not looking.Not looking. (Leaves)
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Narration,Cut to theFearamid. The demons groan.
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Bill,"Alright, can anybody explain to me why, even with our newfound INFINITE POWER,(Lightning strikes the columns)none of us can escape the borders of this STUPID HICK TOWN?!?!(Sits in throne)There's some kind of force field keeping us in, but who would know how to fix it?(Holds Ford)Hmm. Maybesomeoneneeds to come out of retirement.(Eye flashes Journal pages)"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Keyhole,"Bill!(Bill's eye back to normal)Uh, sorry, Boss, butGideonlet the Pines family escape! They're inside Mabel's bubble as we speak!"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Bill,"(Laughs smugly)Buddy, Mabel's bubble is the most diabolical trap I've ever created. It would take a will of titanium not to give into its temptation. Fetch me Gideon and take the rest of the day off. Things just got a little more interesting."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Narration,Cut to Mabeland. Dipper is standing in front of a river.
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Stuffed Animal Tree,"(Singing:)Bum ba bum bo, I'm a stuffed animal tree..."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Stuffed animals,"(Singing:)We're the stuffed animals, tee-hee-hee!"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,"(Angrily throws a stone across the river; it skips while a child's giggling is heard)Ugh, even my stone skips are perfect!(Sighs)Who am I kidding? Maybe Mabel's right. It's a horror show out there. At least the air here is breathable."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Fake Wendy,"Dude, you're talking to a river."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,"Oh, hey, Wendy, what's up? I thought you were busy wrecking the school or whatever."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Fake Wendy,"Yeah, that got old quick. And this music is really starting to get on my nerves. I think that stuff you said about this place is right."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,"Really? Well, now we just need a plan."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Fake Wendy,"Don't worry, you always think of something.(Throws stone, and it skips while giggles are heard, the stone explodes in the sky and a screen pops up that says ""100 POINTS"")You know, you're so much smarter than like everyone else. Heh. It's kinda funny. If you were older, you'd be like, my dream guy."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,"Wait, do you really mean that?"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Fake Wendy,"Wait a minute. In this place you can be any age you want! If we were the same age(Pulls a flower farther out of the ground so that it is as tall as the flower next to it)maybe you and me could, I don't know, actually be together."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,"Wait, really?!"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Fake Wendy,"I bet, if we ask Mabel, she could do it right now! In this place it could finally be just you and me. Come on, man! Just take my hand.(Holds out hand and winks)"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,"Wait, aaahhh,... this isn't real!"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Narration,The Fake Wendy turns into a bunch of centipedes and the sky darkens.
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,(Screams as Fake Wendy dissolves)
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Stuffed animal tree,"You shouldn't have done that, Dipper!!We're watching you."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Stuffed animals,(They now each have one giant eye)THERE ARE EYES EVERYWHERE.

Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Sev'ral Timez,(Each band member one after another:)Hey Dipper!
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Stuffed animal tree,"(Singing:)Dup a dup dup, I'm a stuffed animal treeee~"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,"(Backs away, panting)Oh my gosh. This is crazy. Um- I'm losing my mind. We have to get out of here. We have to go back. To the real. WORLD!(""World"" echoes)"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Narration,The people on the streets turn to Dipper and gasp.
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Mabel,(Gasps)

Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,MABEL! You're smarter than this! Bill has you hypnotized or something! Are you really gonna let them banish me?!
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Mabel,"No! Of course not; that's my brother, guys! There's gotta be another way."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Guard,"Very well. If Dipper wishes to stay, he must plead his case in the ultimate trial. Of fantasy vs. reality."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Soos,(Takes a bite out of the guard)
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Guard,Hey! Seriously?

Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,"Seriously, Mabel? You're letting them take our argument to court?"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Mabel,"Hey, I didn't make the rules in Mabeland."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,"Yes, you did! There's a tapestry of you making the rules!(Gestures to the tapestry)"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Policegiraffe,All rise! For the honorableJudge Kitty Kitty Meow Meow Face-Shwartstein.

Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,"Look, Mabel, this whole thing is ridiculous. But if winning a trial is what it takes to get you to come home with us, then so be it."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Mabel,"I'm sorry, Dipper, but I can only speak through my legal team now."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Xyler and Craz,"(Enter, wearing suits with the sleeves cut off)"

Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Mabel 3,(Falls out of her seat)
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Mabel 6,We're not that lovely.
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Craz,"My case is simple: this very unrighteous dude thinks that reality is better than fantasy.(A board appears and he points at it with a stick)But reality is bogus, lame and whack.(The words ""BOGUS,"" ""LAME,"" AND ""WHACK"" appear on the board as he says them)"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,"Objection your honor, that's conjecture."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Judge Kitty Kitty Meow Meow Face-Shwartstein,Meowverruled.

Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,"Um, well, I, um. I don't-"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Mabel,(Runs away crying)
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,"Mabel, wait!"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Craz,"Mabel's fantasy was having a great school photo, but reality had other plans."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,"(In present:)Look, that was one bad day!"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Xyler,"One of many. February fourteenth, fourth grade. Valentine's Day."

Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,"(Runs out, crying, then trips over a wastebasket)"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Fat kid,(To Mabel:)I can't believe that kid's your brother.
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Narration,Scene changes to the courtroom.
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,"(In present:)Hey, what's the point of all this? That was in the past!"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Xyler,"Is your life any better now, bro?(Mabel's Scrapbook flashes to Dipper sitting on the log by himself inInto the Bunker)Heartbreak.(Flashes to Dipper lying against the tree inWeirdmageddon Part 1)Disaster.(Flashes to Mabel yelling at Dipper inDipper and Mabel vs. the Future)Broken promises. That's reality for you."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Craz,"Out there, it's nothing but heartbreak. But in here, who wants pug sundaes?!(Sundaes appear in the hands of all the Jury Mabels)"

Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,Wait! I haven't even presented my case!
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Judge Kitty Kitty Meow Meow Face-Shwartstein,Do you even have a case?
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,"(Looks at Mabel, who is rocking in her chair and singing to herself, then goes up to the judge)Yes, I do, your honor. I call as a witness: Mabel Pines!"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Narration,The crowd gasps.
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Mabel,Uh... objection?
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Judge Kitty Kitty Meow Meow Face-Shwartstein,I'll allow it. Us cats are famously curious. Meow meow.
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Mabel,(Walks up and sits in the chair while the crowd mutters)
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,"(Sighs)Mabel, listen. I might not have all the answers. I'm not stylish(gestures to Xyler and Craz)and I'm not cool(gestures to Dippy Fresh, who is crowdsurfing)and I can't make pugs appear out of thin air.(Snaps fingers)"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Mabel 4,Booo!

Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Mabel 7,Guilty!
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,"But I know one thing well, and that's you. And I know that although you might act like it, you don't wanna be in this fantasy world."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Mabel,"Uh, pffsh, yeah right."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,"You're scared. Of growing up. And who could blame you; I'm scared, too."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Mabel,"Uh,(covers ears)Lalalalalala, I'm not listening! Guards!(Claps)The fingers!(The guards stick foam fingers in her ears)"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,"Look, real life stinks sometimes, okay, I'm not gonna lie. But there's a better way to get through it than denial, and that's with help from people who care about you. It's how we've gotten through our whole lives. Just look.(Scene changes to the photo day after Mabel got gum in her hair; in flashback:)Mabel! I figured out a way to fix your photo!"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Mabel,(In flashback:)What? You have a wig?
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,"No! But, I have a razor!(Shaves a line down his head)"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Mabel,Haha! You're crazy!(Takes the razor and shaves the part of her hair with gum in it)
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper and Mabel,(Laugh and pose for picture)Haaa!

I actually thought I was gonna stay here and be Ford's apprentice! Spend my entire teens cooped up in a basement with a labcoat? How ridiculous is that? I don't know what's gonna happen in the future, but whatever it is, you don't have to fear because we'll do it together. I'm not taking Ford's apprenticeship. We've traveled to Heck and back to get you and we're goin' back together. Leave this fantasy world. Let's beat Bill and grow up together."

Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Blue Bird,Just don't do it!
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Craz,DON'T DO IT!
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Judge Kitty Kitty Meow Meow Face-Shwartstein,You do this and it's all over!
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Mabel,Sincere sibling hug.(Hugs Dipper)
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Judge Kitty Kitty Meow Meow Face-Shwartstein,DON'T DO THE PATS!
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper and Mabel,"(Pat each other)Pat pat.(A ripple comes from their spot, blowing Judge Kitty Kitty Meow Meow Face-Shwartstein's wig away and one of the benches falls over. All of the jurors disappear)"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Mabel,"(Rubs eyes)Aw, man, I never noticed how bright this place is, ugh! Have I actually been listening to the same song for an entire week?"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Judge Kitty Kitty Meow Meow Face-Shwartstein,(Meows in a distressed manner)
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Mabel,"Whoa, time to calm you down.(Claps twice)Uh, why isn't this working?(Claps)"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Judge Kitty Kitty Meow Meow Face-Shwartstein,Because your reign over this land isOVER!(Splits open and reveals a nightmarish pile of yarn)

Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Mabel,"Alright, guys, are you ready for this?(Grabs a giant knitting needle)Sorry, Mabeland. It's time to burst your BUBBLE!(As Waddles jumps, she breaks the bubble with the needle; the bubble explodes into confetti; she is lying on the ground of the cliff)Ugh. You all good, everyone good?"
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Narration,Waddles shrinks back to his normal size. Everyone is wearing the clothing they were wearing before.
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,"Dipper, Soos and Wendy",(Hug her)
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Soos,"We've missed you, Mabel."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Mabel,"Hey, Dipper? I appreciate what you said back there, but if you want to take Ford's apprenticeship, I won't get in your way."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,Psh. And miss out on your awkward teen years? You wish.(Laughs)
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Mabel,"(Laughs)Man, I went nuts back there. I mean come on. The real world can't be that bad, right?(Looks the other way and seesGompersis still giant and the Fearamid)Oh boy."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Narration,Cut to everyone at ground level.
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Mabel,Where is everyone?
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Wendy,The town's deserted.
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Soos,Did Bill already win?
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,"Come on, guys. Let's see if we can still go hide out in the Shack."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Narration,Cut to theMystery Shack.
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Dipper,Yes! It's in shambles! Just like we left it.
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Wendy,"Oh, man, this is the first time I've ever felt happy going to work."
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Mabel,"(As they are running to it)Hello, house. Hello, porch. Hello, wads of gum I left stuck to the couch."

Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Craz,Where are we?
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Xyler and Craz,(Sit on a bench)
Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality,Xyler,"Are we real? Is this reality? Jean-Paul Sartre postulated that every existing thing is born without reason, prolongs itself out of weakness, and dies by chance."

Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,"(Lights a match and throws it into a can, illuminating the shack, revealing the people sitting around the room)Welcome to what's left of normal around here. Home base."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,The screen pans across the various people hiding in the Mystery Shack.

Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Mabel,"Grunkle Stan, how'd this all happen?"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,"So I was hammering signs out back when the sky started vomiting nightmares. I listen to a lot of AM radio so I knew what this meant: the end of the world.(Flashback of Stan running inside as the weirdness wave descends)What I didn't expect was what happened next.(The totem pole comes to life and attempts to attack the house, but hits a dome around it)Turns out whatever you and my brother did to the shack with yourunicornvoodoo made the crazy place invincible to weirdness.(The totem pole falls over; cut back to the present.)"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Dipper,"Of course, the unicorn spell. That's why this is the only placeBill'smagic can't touch."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,"(Gesturing toOld Man McGucket)That's when Possum Breath over here shows up leading a bunch of injured stragglers through the forest. They needed a place to stay and since themayorgot captured, I elected myself de facto chief. The plan's to stay in here and eatBrown Meatuntil we run out, then I vote we eat the gnomes."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Jeff,"Hey! I'm short, not deaf!"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,Shh! Shh! Stress will make you chewy.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Dipper,"Grunkle Stan, we can't all just hide inside the Shack. There'sa townin need of saving. Me andFordtried to do it, but he got captured by Bill."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,"(Opens can of The Brown Meat)Serves that jerk right. My brother's had some stupid plans, but going up against an all-powerful space demon was his worst one yet. Trust me, we have everything we need right here.(Sits down on a wooden lounge chair surrounded by the Multi-Bear and gnomes)It's not the Ritz but at least the monsters inside know how to massage.(To the Multi-Bear:)You know Shiatsu?"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Multi-Bear,"Yes, I've taken some classes."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Dipper,So you're really just gonna let Bill win?
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,"Look, kiddo. We got a good deal here. Besides, I'm sure wherever the rest of the townsfolk are, they're fine.(Slams his hand down, accidentally hitting the remote and turning on the TV)"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Shandra Jimenez,(On the TV:)This is Shandra Jimenez reporting live from the inside of Bill'scastle. Here for the first time are images of what's happened to the captured townsfolk. Viewers are advised to look away if they don't want to see their friends turned into a twisted throne of human agony.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Pacifica,MomandDad?
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Wendy,Myfamily!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Sheriff Blubs,Deputy Durland!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Shandra,Is there no one who will save the people of this town? I'm Shandra Jimenez and I'm being turned into stone by a flying eyeball.(The TV turns to static)
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,Everyone gasps.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Pacifica,"Oh, no. My parents are bad but eventheydon't deserve to be turned to stone."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Sheriff Blubs,"(Drops down on his knees)Curse you, Bill! Why must you take everything we love?(Rips his shirt open and cries)"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Mabel,"(Climbing on top of the Multi-Bear)Guys, don't you see? Our friends need us, but we can only save them if we fight back.(Pulls Dipper up after her)"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Dipper,Mabel is right. Billwantsus to run and hide. He wants us to think he's invincible. But Ford told me before he was captured that he knows Bill's secret weakness.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,The refugees perk up and start muttering.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Wendy,Weakness?
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Dipper,"Now, if we band together, if we combine all of our strength, our smarts, our...whatever Toby has..."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Toby,Various rashes!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Dipper,"...then we just might be able to rescue Ford, learn Bill's weakness, and save Gravity Falls!"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,Everyone cheers.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,"Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Have you all forgotten who's in charge here? Besides, we're only safe inside! It's not like we can take the Mystery Shack to Bill."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,McGucket,"Wha--Whoa! Holy hootenany! Flapjack and fiddlebanjos! Sorry, sorry. Got a little excited.(Thumps his foot and slaps his knee) What I meant to say is I think I figured out a way to fight Bill and rescue Ford, but we're all gonna have to work together.(Snaps his fingers and a gnome puts glasses on him)Now. If you just..."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,"Dipper, Mabel, Soos, Wendy and McGucket",(Talk unintelligibly)
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Soos,"Don't worry, Ford! We're coming for you!"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,Cut to Ford being tranquilized at the Fearamid.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Ford,"Let me go, you insane three-sided--! Wha--What is this place?(Pulls at a chain on his leg)"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Bill Cipher,"(Rises out of the floor, playing a piano and singing:)We'll meet again. Don't know where, don't know when. Oh, I know we'll meet again some sunny day."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Ford,Wh-where am I?
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Bill,"You're in the penthouse suite, kid! The tip of the pyramid. Have a drink.(Snaps his fingers and a martini glass appears in Ford's hand)Make yourself comfortable.(Takes a sip of his drink as Ford sits down)You know that couch is made from living human skin?"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,"The couch groans as eyes, a nose, and a mouth appear. Ford jumps up."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Ford,"Aaah! Quit the games, Cipher! If I'm still alive, you must want something from me."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Bill,"Ah, sharp as ever, Fordsy. As you may have noticed...I've recently had a(Voice echoing:)multi-dimensional makeover.(Stops echoing and rearranges the room's furniture)I control space, matter, and now thatthat dumb baby's out of the way, time itself! But I wasn't always this way.(Everything falls to the floor)"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Ford,Ooph!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Bill,"You think those chains are tight?(Eye shows a planet on a two-dimensional plane, which burns)Imagine living inthe second dimension, flat minds in a flat world with flat dreams. I liberated my dimension, Stanford, and I'm here to liberate yours. There's just one hitch.(Eye projects a hologram of him pushing against the dome around Gravity Falls)As it turns out, my weirdness can't escape the magical confines of this town. There's something keeping me in."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Ford,Incredible! Gravity Falls'natural law of weirdness magnetism. I studied this years ago!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Bill,And did you find a way to undo it?
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Ford,Of course. There's a simple equation that could collapse the barrier. But I'd never tell you!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Bill,"Listen, Ford, if you just tell me that equation, finally your dimension will be free.(Projects himself drawing a smiley face in the midwest United States, then takes a bite out of the Earth and flies past his friends, who are destroying other planets, then to Ford, who is standing in the middle of a galaxy)Anything will be possible. I'll remake a fun world-- a better world! A party that never ends with a host that never dies! No more restrictions! No more laws! You'd be one of us. All-powerful. Greater than anything you've imagined! And all I need is your help."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Ford,You're insane if you think I'll help you.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Bill,"(Brief cackle)I'm insane either way, brainiac! But have it your way. I'll just fish around and get that equation directly out of your mind!(Enters the mental realm, leaving his physical form as a statue)"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Ford,"Not so fast! You know the rules, Bill.(Bill returns to the physical realm, restoring his statue body)You may be able to haunt my dreams, but you can't enter my mind unless I shake your hand and let you in."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Bill,"(sighs, then chains Ford's legs and neck)You're making this so much harder than it needs to be. Everyone has a weakness, tough guy! I'll make you talk! It's only a matter of time."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Ford,(Screams)
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,Cut to the Mystery Shack.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,McGucket,"(Lays out some blueprints)Alright. I've made some thingamadiculous robomajigs in my day, but this is the first one thatwon'tbe used for evil."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Dipper,"Whoa! These blueprints are incredible, McGucket."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Mabel,This is your most amazing invention yet.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Soos,"Question, does it have any gun-swords? I watch a lot of anime and, uh, trust me, you're gonna want some gun-swords."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,McGucket,"What's an ""anime""?"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Soos,We have much to discuss.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,Discuss nothing! These scribbles are a bunch of cockamamie balderdash! Excuse my French.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,French lilliputtian,Je ne sais quoi sacrebleu au revoir!(Subtitled:)I don't believe that was French.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,And where would you even find a bunch of idiots crazy enough to build it?
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Mabel,"Grunkle Stan, you're looking at those idiots."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,Everyone cheers.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Soos,Idiots!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,"Cut to montage of the refugees building the robot: McGucket points out the parts needed, then people raid the junkyard; cut to people taking stuff from inside the shack."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,Whoa-what! What are you--? H-hey now! Hey hey! Don't touch that! Hey! Aah!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,"Cut to people digging a dinosaur out from theAbandoned mines; Soos showing McGucket anime while the latter takes notes; cuts all the parts being put together and to a ""Take Back the Falls"" flag. Cut to everyone outside the Shack wearingMabel's sweaters."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Soos,"Thanks for these apocalypse sweaters, Mabel. The end of the world has never been so comfortable."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,Some of the refugees nod and hum in agreement.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Pacifica,"(Shivers; Mabel glares at her)Uh! Fine, I'll wear it.(Puts on the llama sweater)But I'm not gonna like it."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Mabel,Admit it. This is the best day of the end of the world. I think we actually have a chance to beat Bill and win back our future.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Dipper,Yeah. Getting to actuallyliveto see our 13th birthday party is the only birthday present I want right now.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Soos,"Hey, if we're lucky enough to get there, I guarantee this whole town is gonna throw you the best birthday party you've ever seen."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Dipper,"Thanks, Soos. Hey, has anyone seen Grunkle Stan?"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,This whole plan is bonkers. But of course no one asked the chief what he thinks. After all I've done for everyone!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Shmebulock,Shmebulock!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,"Yeah, exactly, it's a total load of Shmebulock."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Mabel,"Is something wrong, Grunkle Stan? You're acting grunklier than usual."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,"It's this darn plan to save my brother. If you didn't notice, I already saved him once fromthat portal, and he never thanked me! He causes the end of the world, and somehow it's still always ""Stan's the screw-up. Ford's the hero."""
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Dipper,"Well, maybe people think he's a hero because he didn't want to hide in the Mystery Shack!"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,"Well, maybe if he hid in the Mystery Shack, he wouldn't have been captured!"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Mabel,"Guys! Guys! Trust me, tomorrow's gonna be great! I believe in us."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Chutzpar,Help! Leader Mabel! I keep accidentally flexing through my sweater.(Does so)Augh! It happened again!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Mabel,Those weird cow-monsters are delightful! Coming!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,Cut to the next morning.Gomperswalks across a barren wasteland and bleats.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,McGucket,"Alright, fellas. Let's hope this turns out better than my other inventions."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Mabel,"Everybody ready? Dipper, now!"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,"Dipper pulls a lever, causing wheels to turn. Machinery begins running and the invention starts moving. As the invention stands up, the refugees are tossed side-to-side inside the Shack."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,Cut toBud Gleefulburning someGideondolls.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Bud Gleeful,"Forgive me, boy. Your hyperflamable merchandise is the only thing keepin' me going.(As the robot walks past)What in blazes?"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,The robot approaches the Fearamid.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Ford,No! No! Noooo!!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Bill,(Zaps him)
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Ford,Aaaagh!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Bill,Ready to talk now?
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Ford,(Gasping)I won't... I won't let you into my mind.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Bill,"What do you think, pals? Another five hundred volts? (some rumbling is heard) Hey, do you hear that?"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,The robot's t-rex head crashes through the Fearamid and roars.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Bill,What?! I just fixed that door!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,The Mystery Shack robot comes into full view.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Soos,"It's the Shacktron, dude!(Holds the Take Back the Falls flag, topped with Wax Larry King's head)"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Wax Larry King,They made the house into a robot. Fascinating!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Bill,"So the mortals are trying to fight back, huh? Adorable! Henchmaniacs, you know what to do! Take them out!"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,Bill's minions grow in size and jump out of the Fearamid to stand in front of the Mystery Shack.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,This was a bad idea.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Soos,"(Through a microphone:)Uh, hey, dudes. Is this thing on? Test(Feedback screeches)Heh. Uh, I just wanted you monster dudes to hand over Ford or we'll have to, like, fight and junk. Heh. Hey, you're a little cutie."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Paci-Fire,I have butchered millions on countless moons.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Soos,"Whoa. I liked you better before you talked. Real... real bringdown, this guy."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Pyronica,Attack!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,The demons run at the Shacktron.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Soos,"All right, dudes! (Runs into the Shack)"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Dipper,"Everyone! Like we planned! Three, two, one. Go!"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Candy and Grenda,"(Operate arms, punching away Paci-Fire andKryptos)"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Mabel,"(UsesWaddles' mouth to pull a lever, which causes the Shacktron to shoot several demons away)Ha ha ha. Good pig."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Waddles,(Squeals)
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Eye Bats,(Attack the Shacktron)
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,McGucket,"Get em,Gobblewonker!(Operates a Gobblewonker head on top of the Shacktron, grabbing an eye bat in its mouth)"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Rumble,(Dispatching a pair of eye bats with fireballs)Hya! Hya!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Wendy,"Oh, no, you don't!(Jumps onto an eye bat and pulls its wings, causing it to turn8 Ball's head to stone. Wendy jumps off the eye bat back into the shack)"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Multi-Bear,Everyone! Incoming!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,"(Pulling at a door labeled ""EXIT"")Does this thing have an escape hatch?"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,Zantharrams the Shack and pushes it back. Everyone inside screams.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Mabel,Everybody! Maximum power!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Sev'ral Times,(Runs on a treadmill)
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Dipper,And...now!(Turns a wheel and the Shacktron grabs Zanthar and throws it)
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Teeth,"(Runs away on fire, screaming)"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Bill,"Guys, seriously? You had, like, one job to do here."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Ford,"Bravo, Dipper and Mabel!"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Bill,"Well, would you look at that. Those kids really care about you. And you care about them.(Eye turns red; deep voice:)Don't you?"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Ford,What are you....Oh. Oh no.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Bill,Perhaps torturing those kids'll make you talk.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Ford,No. No! Not the kids! You ca--(Becomes petrified again)
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Bill,"Let's get this over with.(Crawls outside, grows a giant fist and slams it down on the Shacktron; he raises his fist only to find the Shack perfectly fine)What the? No! No! No! No! No!(Grows more arms and pounds at the Shack)"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,Ah!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Mabel,ATTACK!!!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Grenda,"(Punches, causing the T-rex head to lunge at Bill. It bites Bill's eye and pulls back, ripping the eye out of its socket.)"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Bill,Aah! My eye! Do you have any idea how long it takes to regenerate that?!?
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Dipper,We've got him distracted! Now's our chance!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Mabel,"Rescue team, move out!"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,"Mabel puts hergrappling hookin her sweater. Soos puts theMemory Gunin his backpack. Dipper tests theheight-altering crystal flashlighton a Mystery Shack snowglobe. Cut to Dipper, Mabel, Stan, Soos, Wendy, Pacifica and Sheriff Blubs standing in the exit tubes."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Dipper,"Okay everyone. We get in, rescue Ford, get out, save the world. Piece of cake."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Pacifica,"Just so we're clear. If I die, I'm suing all of you."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,"Hey, on second thought, maybe we could come up with a plan thatdoesn'tinvolve us plummeting to our certain death-"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Wendy,"Now!(Presses a button and they are pulled up out of the tubes and shot out of the Gobblewonker's mouth, screaming. They fall towards the Fearamid's opening)"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Dipper,"Oh, man, oh, man..."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Mabel,(Doing cartwheels through the air)WOOHOO! HAHAHA!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,They open their parachutes as they approach the Fearamid. They all land and remove their parachutes. All of them gasp upon seeing Bill's throne.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Dipper,"Oh, man. It looks even worse up close."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Mabel,"(Shoots her grappling hook, which lands on Manly Dan and pulls herself up to the throne)I found Great-uncle Ford!(Tosses the grappling hook down)He's golden, but not in the good way!"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,Great! Grab him and let's get out of here!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Dipper,But how are we going to unfreeze them?
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Gideon,"(Offscreen)I know!(Onscreen, dancing in a cage)"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Mabel,Gideon! What happened to you?
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Gideon,Bill captured me. He's been forcing me to do cute dances in this cage for all eternity.(Sobbing)I'm so tired of being cute!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Dipper,How do we undo this?
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Gideon,Mayor Tyler. He's the load-bearing human. Pull him out and the whole thing goes down.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,"Dipper pulls at Tyler's arm. He rattles before turning back to normal and breaking free. This sets off a chain reaction, causing the chair to collapse. As it does, the residents are returned to normal. Deputy Durland hits Gideon's cage, knocking it down and breaking it, freeing Gideon."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Lazy Susan,"Ugh, my mouth tastes like nightmares..."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Robbie Valentino,(Falls down on his head)Aah! I think I'm dark and tortured for reals now.(A can of spray paint falls out of his hoodie)
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Tad Strange,This experience will forever scar Tad Strange.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Gideon,(Rips off his costume)NO MORE SAILOR SUIT!!!(Pants)
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,Manly Dan and his sons hug Wendy.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Manly Dan,Wendy!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Wendy,Guys!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Pacifica,Mom! Dad!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Sheriff Blubs,"Durland!!!(Runs to Durland, knocking over Priscilla and Preston)"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Deputy Durland,My Blubs!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Sheriff Blubs,Don't you ever scare me like that again!(Hugs him)
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,Everyone claps and cheers.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Ford,"(Tranquilizes)Kids! Ah, you did it! I knew I could count on you two. Haha!(To McGucket:)Fiddleford. I-I haven't seen you since we parted ways. You must hate me."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,McGucket,"I've tried forgettin'. Maybe I should try forgiving. Come here, old friend.(Hugs Ford)"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,"Hey, good to see you too, bro. Now let's get outta here, huh?"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Dipper,"Listen, Uncle Ford, we don't have a lot of time. Remember how you told me right before you were frozen that you knew Bill's weakness?"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Mabel,"Yeah, a secret way to defeat him?"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Ford,"I--I do!(Pulls on gloves)Now, does anyone have a pen? Pencil? Anything?(Sees Robbie's spraypaint can)Ah.(Grabs the can)Perfect.(Draws with the spraypaint)"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Dipper,"Uh, we've got Bill outside, but I don't know how long we can keep him occupied."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Ford,"Yes, yes. Good, good."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,"Drawing a circle on the floor. Well, he's lost his mind."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Ford,My mind is fine. And there is a way to beat him. With this.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,Shot pulls back to show that Ford has drawn theBill Cipher Zodiac.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Pacifica,The world's most confusing game of hopscotch?
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Ford,"No, a prophecy. Although it would be a pretty fun game of hopscotch.(Cut to Ford as a young man in a cave approaching a painting of the zodiac. Voice-over from the present:)Many years ago, I found 10 symbols in a cave. Some I recognized then, some I only recognize now. The native people of Gravity Falls prophesized that these symbols could create a force strong enough to vanquish Bill. With Bill defeated, his weirdness would be reversed and the town could be saved.(Flashback ends)This whole time I thought it was just superstition, but seeing you all here now, I finally understand that it's destiny. Dipper, the pine tree. Mabel, the shooting star."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Dipper and Mabel,(Step on their respective spots)
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Soos,The question mark. This one's unsolvable.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Wendy,(Pushes Robbie onto the stitched heart symbol)That one's easy. You've been rockin' that dumb hoodie since the seventh grade.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Robbie,Whoa. Destiny hoodie.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Dipper,TheTent of Telepathysign! That must be Gideon.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Gideon,(Stands on it)Whoo! An excuse to stand next to Mabel.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Mabel,Don't turn this into a big deal.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Gideon,"Oh, I won't!(Whispering:) I will."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,Cut to Bill with the Shacktron. It punches him and holds him to the ground.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Bill,"(Noticies one of its leg outside of the shield)What the... Hey,Achillles! Nice work with theHEEL!!!(Rips off the leg)FORE!(Hits the Shack with the leg and it rolls away)"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,Cut to inside the Fearamid.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Ford,"Hold hands, everyone. This is a mystical human energy circuit."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Dipper,Ice? Who's ice?
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Ford,"The symbols needn't all be literal, Dipper. It just has to be someone cool in the face of danger."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,"Lee,Nate,Tambry,Thompson",Wendy! Wendy!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Wendy,"Heheh. Shut up, you guys.(Stands on the bag of ice symbol)"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Ford,Much like the spectacles need to be someone scholarly.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,McGucket,(Stands on the glasses symbol)Heeheh!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Pacifica,(Stands on the llama symbol and looks at the llama sweater she's wearing)This is freaky.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Ford,"Now hold hands, everyone."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,McGucket,"(Holds out his hand, which has flies around it, to Pacifica)"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Pacifica,Ew! I'm not touching that.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Preston,"Do it, sweetie. Do the one thing no one in our family has ever done: touch the hillbilly."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Pacifica,(Holds McGucket's hand and everyone in the circle glows. Thunder rumbles and smoke circles around the Fearamid.)
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Dipper,Great-uncle Ford! I think it's working!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,McGucket,Hoohoo! Heehahahaha!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Ford,Yes! This is it!(To the people outside the circle:)The rest of you get out. It's too dangerous!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,The people not in the circle run away.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Ford,"We just need one more person...(sees the empty symbol, which corresponds to Stan)Stanley! Stanley, get over here. You're the only one left."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,"You realize this is a bunch of hogwash, right? You really think some caveman graffiti is gonna stop that monster?"

Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Robbie,I've never held hands this long and I amveryuncomfortable!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,"Whoa. Hey. I'm not the enemy here, people. Don't forget who literally created the end of the world."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Ford,"I'm sorry, Stanley. I know. Just help me fix it. Please."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,"Fine. Just do one thing. Say ""thank you."""
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Ford,What?
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,"I spent 30 years trying to bring you back into this dimension and youstillhaven't thanked me! You want me to shake your hand? Say ""thank you""!"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Ford,Fine. Thank you.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,"(Holds Ford's and Soos' hands)Now, see. Between me and him, I'm not always the bad twin."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Ford,"Between ""him and me.""(Beat; Dipper and Wendy are shocked)Grammar, Stanley."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,"I'll ""grammar Stanley"" you!(Lets go of Soos' hand and hits Ford; the circuit breaks)You stuck up son of a gun! I mean come on!"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Ford,"(Lets go of Robbie's hand and hits Stanley)Don't jeopardize this, you idiot! Everything's on the line!"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Mabel,"Guys, stop it!"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,"Dipper and Mabel pull at Stan and Ford, who are fighting and yelling unintelligibly at each other."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Dipper,Join hands!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,Ford and Stan stop fighting as Bill approaches.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Bill,"Oh no, it's Bill! Right? Isn't that what you're all thinking? Hey, Gideon, why aren't you dancing? Chop chop, huh?"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,"(exclusive to Part I of the split version, Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls)The end credits show, with imagery depicting Bill Cipher and the phenomena seen on the zodiac."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,Cut to first end card.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Soos,"(exclusive to Part II of the split version, Weirdmageddon 4: Somewhere in the Woods)Previously on Gravity Falls, the Mystery Shack crew banded together to try and stop Bill, and there was some mad action. Bill needed Ford to take over the world, but we rescued him and he showed us Bill's secret weakness--till the Stan Bros. messed it all up, which kind of brings us up to date. I'm Soos and I'm on the edge of my seat!"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,"(exclusive to Part II of the split version, Weirdmageddon 4: Somewhere in the Woods)Cut to theme song."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Bill,"(laughs smugly)This is just too perfect! Didn't you brainiacs know the zodiac doesn't work if you don't all hold hands? And what's better, you've brought every threat to my power together in one easy-to-destroycircle!(Burns the circle)"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Dipper,Oh no!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Pacifica,(Notices that her hair is on fire and pats it)Ah! My hair!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Robbie,(Notices that his hair is on fire and pats it)Ah! My hair also!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Bill,(Restrains Stan and Ford)You guys wanna see what happens to your friends when you can't get along?
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,McGucket,Hey! You give them back!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Gideon,"You've gone too far, Cipher!"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Wendy,Yeah! We're not scared of you! (Grabs her ax)
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,McGucket,(Grabs his banjo)
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Bill,"Oh, but you should be.(He snaps his fingers, and everyone except Dipper, Mabel, Ford, and Stan stiffen in unison and make brief choking noises. Their eyes glow yellow and roll into the back of their heads and their mouths hang open as they are lifted up into the air.)"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Mabel,Ah!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Dipper,Oh no!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Bill,"You know, this castle could really use some decorations!(The people who he was holding up are replaced by tapestries with pictures of them screaming in front of their symbols)Looks like it's too late for your friends, Stanford."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,Dipper and Mabel scream as a cage encases them.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,Ah! Kids!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Bill,But you can still save your family. Last chance – tell me how to take Weirdmageddon global and I'll spare the kids!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Dipper,No! Don't do it!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Mabel,Yeah! Bill makes bad deals!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Bill,"Don't you toy with me, Shooting Star! I... SEE... EVERYTHI--!(Eye shows a picture of a galaxy; as Mabel sprays paint in his eye)Ow! Not again! Why?! Every time!"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,"Nice shot, pumpkin."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,Ford and Stan are released from Bill's arms and fall to the ground.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Bill,I just regenerated that eye!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Mabel,Iknowthat hurts because I've accidentally done it to myself! Multiple times!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,Dipper pulls out the height-altering crystal flashlight and enlarges their cage. Dipper and Mabel jump out as Bill continues to scream in pain.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Dipper,Save yourselves! Run! We'll take care of Bill!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Ford,What? That's a suicide mission!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Dipper,Trust us. We've beat him before...
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Mabel,"...and we'll beat him again! (Fist bumps Dipper) Hey! Bill! Come and get us, you pointy jerk!"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,"Bill growls. Dipper and Mabel run off into the Fearamid. Before leaving, Mabel stretches her lips to blow a raspberry."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Ford,What? No! It's too dangerous!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,"Ford and Stan start to run after Dipper and Mabel, but Bill puts them in a cage."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Bill,(Opens eye)Not so fast. You two wait here!(Turns red and grows six arms)I've got some children I need to make intoCORPSES!!!(Deep gravelly voice:)See ya real soon!(Runs off)
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,"No! Wait! No! No! Oh, what do we do? What do we do?!"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Ford,(Bangs on bars)Kids!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,"Dipper and Mabel run through the Fearamid, with Bill chasing them."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Bill,"When I get my hands on you kids, I'm gonnaDISASSEMBLE YOUR MOLECULES!!!You've tricked me for the last time!(Tries to grab them, but they fly away on the grappling hook)"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,Cut to Ford and Stan.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,"Oh, I can't believe this. The kids are gonna die and it's all my fault. Because I couldn't shake your stupid hand! Uh,dadwas right about me. I am a screw-up."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Ford,"Ah, don't blame yourself. I'm the one who made a deal with Bill in the first place. I fell for all his easy flattery. You would have seen him for the scam artist he is."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,How did things get so messed up between us?
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Ford,We used to be like Dipper and Mabel. The world's about to end and they still work together. How do they do it?
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,"Easy. They're kids. They don't know any better.(As Ford stands up)Whoa, where you goin'?"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Ford,"I'm going to play the only card we have left – let Bill into my mind. He'll be able to take over the galaxy and maybe even worse, but at least hemightlet the kids free."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,What?! Are you kiddin' me?! Are you honestly telling me there's nothing else we can do?!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Ford,"Bill's only weak in the mind space. If I didn't have this darn plate in my head, we could just erase him with the memory gun when he steps inside my mind."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,What if he goes intomymind? My brain isn't good for anything.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Ford,(brief chuckle)There's nothing in your mind he wants. Ithasto be me. We need to take his deal. It's the only way he'll agree to save you and the kids.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,Do you really think he's gonna make good on that deal?
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Ford,What other choice do we have?
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,Cut to Dipper and Mabel running through the Fearamid. They scream as they reach a dead end.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Dipper,"You know, I'm starting to think there's no way out of here."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Mabel,"Like Grunkle Stan always says, when one door closes, choose a nearby wall and bash it in with brute force!(Grows her hand with the flashlight and punches through the wall)AHHH!(Shrinks her hand back to normal)"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Dipper,"Ha! Now let's round up the townsfolk and together we can defeat...oh, no! (Sees the rest of the refugees tied on the ground, guarded by the demons)"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Grenda,"You'll never take us alive, monsters!"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Teeth,That's fine with us!(Eats Shmebulock)
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Dipper,"Oh, no."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Bill,Peeka-boo!(Catches them in a tractor beam)
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Dipper and Mabel,Aaah!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Bill,"(Re-enters the main room with Dipper and Mabel in his hand)Alright, Ford, time's up! I've got the kids! I think I'm gonna kill one of 'em now just for the heck of it! EENIE... MEENIE... MINEE...(Eye switches between the pine tree and shooting star symbol with each word, then ends on the shooting star.)YOU...!!(He holds up his other hand and prepares to end Mabel by snapping his fingers.)"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,(Wearing Ford's clothes and imitating Ford's voice)WAIT! I surrender.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Bill,Good choice.(Drops Dipper and Mabel)
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Ford,"(Wearing Stan's clothes and imitating Stan's voice)Don't do it, Ford! It'll destroy the universe!"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,It's the only way!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Bill,"(laughs evilly)Oh, even when you're about to die, you Pines twins just can't get along.(Drops the cage and ties up Ford)"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,My only condition is that you let my brother and the kids go!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Bill,Fine.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Dipper,"No, Grunkle Ford! Don't trust him!"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Bill,"It's a... DEAL! (Holds Stan's hand, then enters the mental realm, petrifying his physical form as he laughs evilly and enters Stan's mind)Oh, I'm here. I'm finally here! Look at this place: a perfect, calm, orderly void. Gotta hand it to ya, Ford. You really know how to clear your--(Opens the door to seeStanon his chair in the Mystery Shack's living room with a paddleball)"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,(Makes a clicking sound and points a finger-gun at Bill)
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Bill,WHAT?!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,"Heh heh! Do a pretty good impression of my brother, don't I? Switch clothes and no one can tell us apart. Welcome to my mind. Surprised you didn't recognize it."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,"Outside of Stan's mind, Ford takes off Stan's fez and pulls out the memory gun. He enters ""Stanley Pines"" and hesitantly aims it at his brother. Cut back to Stan's mind."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Bill,WHAT?!The deal's off!!(The door then shuts and the room starts to burn with blue fire)What the- No NO NO NO!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,"Oh yeah. You're going down, Bill. You're gettin' erased. Memory gun. Pretty clever, huh?"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Bill,Y-You idiot! Don't you realize you're destroying your own mind too?!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,Eh. It's not like I was using this space for much anyway.
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Bill,"LET ME OUTTA HERE! LET MEOUT!(attempts to use his powers, only to realize too late that they are now being negated thanks to the memory gun's influence)Gah! Why isn't this working?!"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,"Hey, look at me. Turn around and look at me, you one-eyed demon! You're a real wise-guy, but you made one fatal mistake – you messed with my family."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Bill,"You'remaking a mistake! I'll give you anything;(Eye shows a picture of a dollar sign, a star, a pot of gold and a galaxy)money! Fame! Riches! Infinite power, your own galaxy!PLEASE!(Succumbs to the memory gun's influence)NO!What's happening to me?!(Flashes between several distorted forms; speaking backwards:)!nruter yam I taht rewop tneicna eht ekovni I !nrub ot emoc sah emit ym ,L-T-O-L-O-X-A(Speaking normally:)STAAANNLLEEEEY!!"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,"(Punches Bill in the eye and Bill disintegrates with a fading scream. Stan pants, then picks up a picture of him with Dipper, Mabel and Waddles)Heh. Guess I was good for something after all."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,"The flames engulf him. Cut to outside of Stan's mind. Once Ford finishes erasing Stan's memory he drops the memory gun. The others from the wheel return to normal and drop to the floor. Outside of the Fearamid, the rift sucks all of the demons back into it, returning them to theNightmare Realmfrom whence they came. Teeth spits out Shmebulock as he gets pulled away."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,The Horrifying Sweaty One-Armed Monstrosity,Hey! Hey!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,"The Fearamid is deconstructed and pulled into the rift. Once it is gone, a wave washes over the town, restoring it to its pre-Weirdmageddon state. The townsfolk look around, andXyler, Crazand Rumble all fade away. The forest is shown with a bird landing on Bill's physical form, now permanently petrified and covered in moss and vegetation. Cut to another part of the forest with Stan still collapsed on the ground. He opens his eyes."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Mabel,"(Runs up to Stan and puts his fez on him)Oh, my gosh! Grunkle Stan, you did it!"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,"Oh, uh, hey there...kiddo. What's your name?"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Mabel,Eheh. Grunkle Stan?
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,Heh.(Looks around)Who you talkin' to?
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Mabel,"C-cmon. It's me. It's me, Grunkle Stan.(As Dipper pulls her back)Grunkle Stan, it's me!"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Ford,"We had to erase his mind to defeat Bill. It's all gone. Stan has no idea, but he did it. He saved the world. He saved me.(Kneels down next to Stan)You're our hero, Stanley.(Hugs him)"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,"Mabel sits down and cries. Dipper puts his hand on her shoulder and cries as well. Cut to everyone in front of the Mystery Shack, which is laying in a heap in the woods. They walk up to the door. Ford and Stan have changed back into their regular outfits. Dipper tackles the door until it comes down. Everyone walks into the living room, Dipper and Mabel holding Stan's hands."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,"Hey, this is a real nice place you got here."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Dipper,"It'syourplace, Grunkle Stan."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Mabel,Don't you remember? Even a little?
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,"(Sitting down in the recliner)Nope. But this chair hugs my butt like it remembers. Ah.(Looks at everyone else, who are looking at him sadly)Hey, why the long faces? You guys look like it's someone's funeral.(Whispering:)Who's that big guy crying in the corner?"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Soos,(Sobs and turns away)
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Dipper,"We saved the world, but what's the point? Grunkle Stan's not himself anymore."

There's gotta be something around here that can help bring him back!(Grabs her scrapbook, sits next to Stan in the recliner and opens it)This'll work! This has to work! Here's the first day we came to Gravity Falls, Grunkle Stan. And here's a macaroni interpretation of my emotions.(Flips through the pages)"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Dipper,Thattime we went fishing? ThatSummerweenwe spent together? Don't you remember anything?

Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Dipper,It's happening! Keep going!
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Mabel,"OK, OK. ""Day two. Grunkle Stan smells weird but we're starting to bond. He told us a lot about being a business man in the '80s and seemed happy when we pretended to listen. He also gave me a grappling hook which everyone is impressed by.

Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,Everyone else laughs with her. Cut to a woodpecker landing on the Welcome to Gravity Falls sign. A gnome pops up and eats the bird.

Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Tyler,"None of us really understand what just happened and none of us want to. That's why I'm passing the Never Mind All That Act. If anyone goes asking around about the ""events"" of the last few days, what do we say?(A banner saying ""NEVER MIND ALL THAT"" drops)"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Crowd,Never mind all that!

Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Ford,"Stanley, I need to talk to you.(Leads him behind the shack)I didn't wanna say anything with everyone listening, but we've got a problem. Weirdmageddon has been contained but I'm detecting some strange new anomalies near the Arctic Ocean.(Shows a holographic map of the world on his watch)I want to go investigate it but I think I might be too old to go it alone."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,Are you sayin' you need someone to help you sail around the world in the adventure of a lifetime?

Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Ford,"Heh! I'd say there's a high probability. But, what should we do with the Mystery Shack?"
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,I think the town's had enough mystery for one lifetime. Are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Narration,"Stan and Ford start talking unintelligibly. Soos walks up behind them, eating cake, and gasps when he overhears their conversation. Cut to Stan and Ford on the porch with Dipper and Mabel."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Stan,"(Tapping a Pitt cola bottle)Everyone, I have an announcement to make. Me and my...heh!... nerdy bro over here have some catchin' up to do. We're gonna be away for a while. That's why I'm shutting down the Mystery Shack for good."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Crowd,(Gasp and murmur)
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Soos,"You shut down yourmouthfor good!(beat)I'm sorry, Mr. Pineses. It's just that this shack is the most magical place on Earth. Sure, the attractions are all fake, but dreams aren't fake!(Holds up a Fiji mermaid taxidermy)Like, this mermaid. It's not just a dead fish butt sewn to a monkey carcass. It's a marvelous creature that makes us believe that anything is possible. You shut down this shack, and you shut down our dreams!(takes off his hat)At least...my dreams."
Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls,Crowd,Aww.
